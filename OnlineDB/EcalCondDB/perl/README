	      Online Conditions Database Perl Utilities


These perl programs are used to create and administer the ECAL online
conditions database.  In order to use the programs, you must first
define which machine/database you are connecting to with a
ConnectionFile.pm file somewhere in your library path.  See
lib/ConnectionFile* for example.  To use these examples simply make a
soft link:

prompt> ln -s lib/ConnectionFileOracle-local.pm ConnectionFile.pm
