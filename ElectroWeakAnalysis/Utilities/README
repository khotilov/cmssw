src/EwkPdfWeightProducer.cc
===========================
- Writes into the data structure a std::vector<double> containing the LHAPDF weights 
  PDF_user(i)/PDF__in_generated_sample for each event, where 
  PDF_user(i) corresponds to the PDF set chosen by the user in the configuration file
  and i runs over the total number of members in the set. These weights can be 
  easily used later to assign systematics. Example of usage:

      process.ewkPdfWeights = cms.EDProducer("EwkPdfWeightProducer",
            PdfInfoTag = cms.untracked.InputTag("generator"),
            #Look inside the $LHAPATH/ directory for all possible PDF set choices
            PdfSetName = cms.untracked.string("cteq65.LHgrid")
      )

- WARNING AT CREATION TIME: At present (version 312) you are forced to link against 
  your own full LHAPDF libraries in order to be reasonably fast. Hopefully this 
  will change in the future. Details on how to use your own LHAPDF library in 
  the simpelst way are given inside "BuildFile".

- A simple example showing how to use this PDF information is given in 
  "test/EwkPdfWeightAnalyzer.cc". A test example is "test/EwkPdfWeightAnalyzer.py".

src/DistortedMuonProducer.cc
============================

- Writes into the data structure a new reco::Muon collection and its associated 
  reco::Track (innerTrack modified) collection after smearing and efficiency 
  effects. This new collection can be easily used as a realistic Monte Carlo 
  prediction for the latest steps of the analysis. One can provide the necessary 
  distortions as a function of pseudorapidity via vectors in the configuration file. 
  To include momentum distortions properly we require a previous matching between 
  reconstructed and generated muons using standard CMSSW matching utilities.  
  Example of usage:

      process.genMatchMap = cms.EDFilter("MCTruthDeltaRMatcherNew",
        src = cms.InputTag("muons"),
        matched = cms.InputTag("genParticles"),
        distMin = cms.double(0.15),
        matchPDGId = cms.vint32(13)
      )   

      process.distortedMuons = cms.EDFilter("DistortedMuonProducer",
        MuonTag = cms.untracked.InputTag("muons"),
        GenMatchTag = cms.untracked.InputTag("genMatchMap"),
        EtaBinEdges = cms.untracked.vdouble(-2.1,2.1), # one more entry than next vectors
        MomentumScaleShift = cms.untracked.vdouble(1.e-3),
        UncertaintyOnOneOverPt = cms.untracked.vdouble(2.e-4), #in [1/GeV]
        RelativeUncertaintyOnPt = cms.untracked.vdouble(1.e-3),
        EfficiencyRatioOverMC = cms.untracked.vdouble(0.99)
      )

- A simple example showing how to use this code is given in "test/distortedMuons.py".

src/DistortedMETProducer.cc
===========================

- Writes into the data structure a new reco::MET collection after distortion.
  This new collection can be easily used as a realistic Monte Carlo 
  prediction for (muon-uncorrected) MET at the latest steps of the analysis. 
  At present, only the simplest possibility of scaling MET and sum(ET) by 
  a global scale factor is implemented, and no matching with GenMET has been 
  tried yet. Example of usage:

      process.distortedMET = cms.EDFilter("DistortedMETProducer",
        MetTag = cms.untracked.InputTag("met"),
        MetScaleShift = cms.untracked.double(0.1)
      )

- A simple example showing how to use this code is given in "test/distortedMET.py".
