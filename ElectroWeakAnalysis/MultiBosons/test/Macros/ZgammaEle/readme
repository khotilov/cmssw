How to use:
(A)Run on MC:
   (1) Modify Input_table_Sig, the format is:
   ProcessTag   input_file_name  cross-section_@1/pb(LO)  #total_unskimmed_event

   ps. the event wieght is calculated: cross-section / #total_unskimmed_event

   (2) run: root -b Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       It will create a root file which save some information.
       You can change eleID/phoID/deltaR cut in Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       For other cut, you can modify them in Zg_SelectorMC.C
       (search for "Set Cut")

   (3) Print out the event yield:
       run: root -b print_Event.C
       It will create a .txt file record the event yield information
       The input file is created by Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       (You may need to modify the input file name)
       You can change luminosity and set NLO cross-section in this file.
       ex. McLumi=100., SetMCNLO=true, and set kFactor for each samples

(B)Run on Data
   (1) Modify the input dataset in ZgSelectData.h
   (2) run: root -b Run_ZgSelectData.C
       It will create a root file which save some information, and show all the Zgamma->eegamma candidates.
       You can change eleID/phoID/deltaR/Zmass cut in Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       For other cut, you can modify them in ZgSelectData.C
       
(C)Make plots for MC/Data comparison
   run: root -b CombineHistogram.C
   You need the output file from Run_ZgSelectData.C and Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
   You also need to set the MC luminosity and set k_factor in CombineHistogram.C
   It will create a root file which save all comparison plot after each steps
