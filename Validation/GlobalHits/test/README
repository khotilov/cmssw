This package uses the geometry information of the subdetectors and the
simulated output from OscarProducer to find simulated hits of the full
CMS detector in global coordinates (i.e. a port of ExSimHitStatistics
to CMSSW). It puts into the event a PGlobalSimHit object as defined in
SimDataFormats/GlobalValidation.

It is possible to use three .cfg files to run the package:

EvtGen+DetSim+Global.cfg runs the full chain of event generation, detector
	simulation and global translation making use of local .cfi files
	in the data directory (and in some cases standard files when
	available and appropriate). For instance, you can quickly change
	between different generators by uncommenting the one you want and
	commenting all others. Right now EGun and Pythia have .cfi files.

Or one can run:
EvtGen+DetSim.cfg which just runs the event generation and detector simulation
	using the same .cfi files as above. The output file can then be
	processed by GlobalValProducer.cfg to produce the same output file
	as the full chain, but allowing for faster turn-around while debugging
	the code

GlobalValProducer.cfg uses as input a root file created by SimG4Core, by 
	default the file produced by running EvtGen+DetSim.cfg

To execute type cmsRun -p *.cfg

Also included is a MakeHistograms.C macro that processes the output root file
 	from GlobalProducer creating a .ps file with formatted histograms as 
	well as a root file holding the same histograms. This macro makes
	use of the PGlobalSimHit accessor methods, so a .rootrc and rootlogon.C
	file is provided to load the FWLite package to provide this
	functionality.

Future revisions will include macros to perform the actual validation based
	on the PGlobalSimHit information.
