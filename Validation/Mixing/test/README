Validation test:
----------------
The validation test verifies that bunchcrossings are correctly filled by the 
MM, and that values like the vertex pointers and ToF etc are 
correctly shifted. For that it executes the MM for each bunchcrossing, 
restricting the bunchrange to this crossing only, and adding exactly 1 event as a pileup, 
which is the same as the signal event.
   Rereading the output of the 
MM with TestSuite, it produces a root-file 
containing histograms ("histos.root"), which can be looked at interactively 
with the root macro testsuite.C. There also is the possibility of comparing to a reference 
version using oval, in this case the sigma of every histogram is printed and compared.

To execute the testsuite:

In the test-directory, type

- 'chmod +x testsuite.sh'  to make the shell script executable

- './testsuite.sh'         to execute it. Or if you want to use the oval verification:
    ovalv1 p testsuite.sh

  You should find    root-files     Cum_-5.root ,...,Cum_3.root

- start a root-session and type '.x testsuite.C'
  You should see a certain number of Canvasses containing histograms
