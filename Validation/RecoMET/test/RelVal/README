[About]

This is the Missing Et validation tool. Combined with the
Validation/RecoMET package in CMSSW, it will produce plots
indicating compatibility between software releases with
an easily readable html interface.

[Installation]

No installation is required by this tool. It contains a
Makefile which, assuming ROOTSYS has been properly set in
your environment, will build the required executables.

It can be run interactively by typing "gmake", however
the RunRelVal.sh script will invoke "gmake" before each
run to ensure that the latest RelVal code is being used
(providing no changes have been made to the source code,
this command does nothing).


[Usage]

The RunRelVal.sh script is the main utility for launching
a release validation job. To use this script, modify the
Datadir_New and Datadir_Rel variables at the top of the
script to indicate the path where your RelVal histograms
exist, and also enter the appropriate data samples for
comparison. Then type:

sh RunRelVal.sh [options...]

... Where the optional options modifier consists of:

	[-m]	MET validation

	[-c]	CaloTower validation

  [-h]	HCAL RecHit validation	

  [-e]	ECAL RecHit validation


Without options, RunRelVal.sh will not run any validation jobs.
If options are specified, ONLY the specified jobs will run.

IMPORTANT:

If RunRelVal.sh has been run previously, it will ask if the
existing RelVal directories should be deleted or not. If
the previous areas are saved (responding with (n)ever to the
dialog), then RunRelVal.sh will only validate the jobs which
had not been previously run.

For example, running:

	sh RunRelVal.sh -mce

... will launch MET, CaloTowers, and ECALRecHits but not
HCALRecHits comparisons. Running:

	sh RunRelVal.sh

... would then only need to run the HCALRecHits code, provided
that the (n)ever delete is selected when prompted.


[Output]

After running RunRelVal.sh, a directory will appear under the
installation called "RelVal". Opening this directory in a web-
browser will show the in-progress job status. The following
clickable buttons may appear:

	N/A				The job has not been run

	No Data		The selected data sample was not found, or the
						specified collection was not found within it.

	Fail			The histograms were not compatible

	Pass			The histograms were all compatible
