\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->
Generates minimum bias events with nmu_min muons prompt of from decays of b/c hadrons/tau lepton or longer lived particles such as Kaons or pions. The parameter nmu_min can be defined but by default is 1. The events are given a weight according to the chance of such an event to occur, as in this process events are forced to have a muon produced within the solenoid.
