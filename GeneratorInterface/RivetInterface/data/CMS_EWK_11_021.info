Description:
  Measurements are presented of event shapes and azimuthal correlations in the inclu-
  sive production of a Z boson in association with jets in proton-proton collisions. The
  data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb1, collected with the CMS detec-
  tor at the CERN LHC at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. This to test perturbative QCD predictions
  TeV. allowsand evaluate a substantial background to most physics channels. Studies performed
  as a function of jet multiplicity for inclusive Z boson production and for Z bosons with
  transverse-momenta greater than 150 GeV, are compared to predictions from Monte
  Carlo event generators that include leading-order multiparton matrix-element (with
  up to four hard partons in the final state) and next-to-leading-order simulations of
  Z + 1-jet events. The results are corrected for detector effects, and can therefore be
  used as input to improve models for describing these processes.
