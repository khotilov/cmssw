  This is the official CVS directory for *physics objects* and 
  *physics analysis* related to the CMS Heavy-Ions Physics Group. 
  The main administrators of this CVS area are the CMS-HI conveners. 
  Ask them for permission rights if you want to add code in this area 
  (you'll be then added to the list of developers).


  Creating an analysis area in the Heavy-Ions repository
  ------------------------------------------------------


  To create a CVS area for yourself, do the following:

    1) Create your package (here for an example "HeavyIonsCentrality" object,
       please use a similar syntax for any new package name):
  
        (set your CVSROOT to point to the CMSSW CVS repository)

	source /afs/cern.ch/cms/sw/cmsset_default.csh
	project CMSSW
	scramv1 list | grep CMSSW_X_X
	scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_X_X_X
	cd CMSSW_X_X_X/src
	eval `scramv1 runtime -csh` (or appropiate option if your shell is not `cshell`)

        (start the package creation)

        cvs co HeavyIonsAnalysis/README
        mkdir HeavyIonsAnalysis/HeavyIonsCentrality
        cd HeavyIonsAnalysis
        cvs add HeavyIonsCentrality
  
      In general it is advisable to structure it like a normal CMSSW package,
      i.e. with the same subdirectory structure. To do this, you can do:
  
         mkdir HeavyIonsCentrality/src HeavyIonsCentrality/interface
         cvs add HeavyIonsCentrality/src HeavyIonsCentrality/interface
         mkdir HeavyIonsCentrality/data HeavyIonsCentrality/test
         cvs add HeavyIonsCentrality/data HeavyIonsCentrality/test
 
      If you do not think you need some of these subdirectories at the
      moment, you simply do not 'mkdir' and 'cvs add' them.
 
    2) Then you can 'cd' into the "src" area of some scram working/developer
       area and do:
  
         cvs co HeavyIonsAnalysis/HeavyIonsCentrality
  
      and begin to add your code and cfg files to the subdirectories. If you 
      need a BuildFile, you can copy an example from a normal CMSSW package 
      and edit it to serve your purposes: 
      https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideBuildFile


    3) If you intend for your code to go into CMSSW releases, ask please 
       the CMS-HI conveners to request it via the Tag Collector.
