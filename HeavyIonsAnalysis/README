  This is the official CVS directory for *physics objects* and 
  *physics analysis* related to the CMS Heavy-Ions Physics Group. 
  The main administrators of this CVS area are the CMS-HI conveners. 
  Ask them for permission rights if you want to add code in this area 
  (you'll be then added to the list of developers).


  Creating an analysis area in the Heavy-Ions repository
  ------------------------------------------------------

  The correct way to create a new package is by using the form at:
  
  http://cmstags.cern.ch/cgi-bin/CmsTC/CreateNewPackage

  If you intend for your code to go into CMSSW releases, please ask 
  the CMS-HI conveners to request it via the Tag Collector.

  Creating a user area in the CMSSW repository
  --------------------------------------------

  There is an area called "UserCode" in the CMSSW repository where you can
  create yourself a package to store your code and cfg files.
  
  To create such a package, follow the instructions in /UserCode/README
