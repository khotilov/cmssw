\section desc Description
Persistent classes for mathematical types.

\subsection interface Public interface
- math::Error <b><N></b>: NxN symmetric matrix.  The elements are stored as <tt>Double32_t</tt>,
  i.e.: are stored as <tt>float</tt> and represented in memory as <tt>double</tt>. A functionally
  equivalent class has been requested to the ROOT team. Will be replaced by this new class as
  soon as available.

\subsection typedefs 
- math::XYZVector: spatial vector with cartesian internal representation.
- math::RhoEtaPhiVector: spatial vector with cylindrical internal representation using pseudorapidity.
- math::RThetaPhiVector: spatial vector with polar internal representation.
- math::XYZPoint: point in space with cartesian internal representation.
- math::XYZTLorentzVector: Lorentz vector with cartesian internal representation.
- math::PtEtaPhiELorentzVector: Lorentz vector with cylindrical internal representation using pseudorapidity.
- math::Vector <b>&lt;N&gt;::type</b>: Fixed dimension N-component vector.

\subsection modules Modules
None.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
None.

\section status Status and planned development
Stable. Few classes to be migrated to Root MathCore types.
