\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

This note is intended as a ``working document'' to collect the
description of the format of the raw data transmitted via S-LINK64 by
the Front End Drivers (FED) of the different subdetectors to the DAQ.

In Section~\ref{sec:CommonFormat}, the common format of FED headers
and trailers is described. The detector-specific payload is described
in the subsequent sections.
