	* add new files to define commonly used jet correction services
	and producers. New mechanism based on JetCorrectionEra_cff.py
	allows for these files (JetCorrectionServices_cff.py and
	JetCorrectionProducers_cff.py) to remain valid when new correction
	parameters become available.
	* Some files in python/ are obsolete or need updating (JPT!?), to
	be followed up soon!
