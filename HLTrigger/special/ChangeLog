       	* Added two new filters dedicated to BeamGas events selection:
      	  HLTHFAsymetryFilter and HLTPixelAsymetryFilter. Corresponding python
       	  configuration files were also added.

	* A small test script was added in ~/test/ directory, test_AsymFilters_cfg.py.  
	  It runs directly on Raw data.
