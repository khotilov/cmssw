RateEff/RateVsLumiFitter
========================

This module contains Roberto Rossin's rate vs. luminosity fitter.

Usage:

- lumiByLS_maker.sh:
  produces a lumi-vs-LS table for a given run (output: x.icc)

- correctLumiMap.C:
  takes x.icc, applies some correction
  produces x_corr.icc

- runRateEffParallel.sh:
  runs OHltRateEff in parallel on a list of datasets,
  and for each dataset on several cfg files, for several runs;
  the output is just a list of the usual RateEff root files (plus log files)

- FitRatesPerLS.C:
  runs on the root files produces by runHighPU.sh;
  produces fit plots for the paths belonging to a given "dataset" (cfg file tuple)
