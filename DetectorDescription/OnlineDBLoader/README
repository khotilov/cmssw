README FOR CMS Detector Gemoetry Dtabase (DGD)

The steps to create CMS DGD database is below:
(1) run CMS_DTCTR_GEOMETRY_OWNER.sql under any sqlplus.
(2a) run asciidump.py on any linux machine that has python 2.3 or above installed.
    Make sure you have a correct configuration.xml that lists all the 
    subdetectors' XML files. And these are avaiable to you.
(2b)run COBRA_8_4_0/src/DDD/DDRegressionTest/test/physicalparts_table.cpp with 
    a correct configuration.xml to generate data for tables NOMINALPLACEMENTS and 
    PHYSICALPARTSTREE.
(3) Correctly setup oracle on any linux machine. Run load_all_tables.sh script
    to generat the rest of data.

Note We have data generated from the XMLs listed in the configuration.xml file 
in the CVS. So one can load these data and scape step 2. If you think the XML
files are changed, you should use the new XML files to generated the new data.
