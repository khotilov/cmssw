	* tag V00-01-00
	* remove option 'ownsMemory': before, a FUShmBuffer[Cell] could be
	constructed in regular memory. Not anymore!
	* there should be no use case for this anymore, but if (?!)
	anybody would ever be tempted to construct a FUShmBufferCell
	outside the static accessors of FUShmBuffer, it *must* be via a
	'placement new': cell = new (addr) FUShmBufferCell(..), where addr
	better point to a valid chunk of shared memory. DON'T DO IT!
	* fixed typo in API: shm_dettach -> shm_detach (spotted by
	Emilio:)

	* tag V00-00-01
	* first import into CVS
	* the classes FUShmBuffer and FUShmBufferCell are being transfered
	from the EventFilter/ResourceBroker package, from which they are
	being removed.
	* The EventFilter/ResourceBroker/bin content is being transfered
	as well: it contains simple test applications to check the
	synchronization issues when concurrently writing/reading to the
	shared memory buffer.
