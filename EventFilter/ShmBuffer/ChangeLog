	* tag V00-00-01
	* first import into CVS
	* the classes FUShmBuffer and FUShmBufferCell are being transfered
	from the EventFilter/ResourceBroker package, from which they are
	being removed.
	* The EventFilter/ResourceBroker/bin content is being transfered
	as well: it contains simple test applications to check the
	synchronization issues when concurrently writing/reading to the
	shared memory buffer.
