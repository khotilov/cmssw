	* add boolean flag epInitialized_ which indicates to the
	initEventProcessor() method if any initalization is
	necessary. Each time the 'parameterSet' parameter is reset via
	XDAQ, the flag will be set to 'false', indicating
	(re-)initialization is necessary.
	* use evf::FsmFailedEvent (EventFilter/Utilities V00-11-11) to
	force the FUEP into 'Failed' state whenever an exception is raised
	in any of the transitional state actions.

	* prescale relevant changes by Chris
	* add rcmsStateNotifier from xdaq2rc package to inform run control
	of self-triggered transition into target state

	* no tag :(
	* change to asynchronous state model
	* incorporate prescale relevant code from Chris
	* missing from the code is the asynchronous notification of run
	control (function manager) of the arrival in the target
	state. To do this, the xdaq2rc library will be employed, which
	will be available in xdaq 3.8.
