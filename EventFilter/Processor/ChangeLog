	* tag V01-01-02
	* fix halting to call detachDqmFromShm only when shm is present

2007-08-14  Emilio Meschi  <emilio.meschi@cern.ch>

	* tag V01-01-00
	* fixed bug in handling state transition in case of bad configuration
	* removed PLUGIN_PATH from web page
	* removed MonitorDaemon initialization (obsolete)
	* added reasonForFailed to web page
	* mispace -> monitorInfoSpace_

	* tag V01-00-05
	* create monitorable infospace the xdaq3.9 (xmas) way

	* tag V00-11-02
	* compliant with edm::EventProcessor for pre2
	* based on evf::StateMachine provided by EventFilter/Utilities
	V00-12-00
	* stopping and halting logic now should function properly

2007-03-10  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-11-01
	* ready to go back in the nightly! :)
	* reverted to od halting strategy (edm::EP::shutDownAsync() instead
	of edm::EP::stopAsync()), edm::EP needs to be enabled to cleanly
	stop first, note that 'Stop' command won't work properly for
	current FUEventProcessor

2007-03-08  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-11-00
	* collect fixes commited by Chris Y.
	* compliant with FWCore reorganization in 140 series
	* based on evf::StateMachine provided by EventFilter/Utilities
	V00-12-00
	* runtime test shows PluginManager related segfault, to be
	investigated. 
	* for stopping and halting logic to function properly,
	edm::EventProcessor needs some fixes, Emilio is taking care of
	that.

	* add boolean flag epInitialized_ which indicates to the
	initEventProcessor() method if any initalization is
	necessary. Each time the 'parameterSet' parameter is reset via
	XDAQ, the flag will be set to 'false', indicating
	(re-)initialization is necessary.
	* use evf::FsmFailedEvent (EventFilter/Utilities V00-11-11) to
	force the FUEP into 'Failed' state whenever an exception is raised
	in any of the transitional state actions.

2007-02-24  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* prescale relevant changes by Chris
	* add rcmsStateNotifier from xdaq2rc package to inform run control
	of self-triggered transition into target state

2007-02-21  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* no tag :(
	* change to asynchronous state model
	* incorporate prescale relevant code from Chris
	* missing from the code is the asynchronous notification of run
	control (function manager) of the arrival in the target
	state. To do this, the xdaq2rc library will be employed, which
	will be available in xdaq 3.8.
