	* no tag :(
	* change to asynchronous state model
	* incorporate prescale relevant code from Chris
	* missing from the code is the asynchronous notification of run
	control (function manager) of the arrival in the target
	state. To do this, the xdaq2rc library will be employed, which
	will be available in xdaq 3.8.
