	* PlaybackRawDataProvider is an EDAnalyzer to be run in a
	FUEventProcessor (see EventFilter/Processor). It will read the
	FEDRawDataCollection from one event and wait until the collection
	was picked up before retrieving the next. The client to pick up
	those collections is BU (see EventFilter/AutoBU). The data will be
	provided to the Filter Farm code as if coming from the builder
	unit(s) online.
