	* fedData_ is a member of BU now; it is a vector of fed buffers,
	the length of each buffer is kept in fedSize_. Now, the fed header
	and trailer (and their sizes!) are included in fedData_ and
	fedSize_ (used to be payload only).
	* BU::createSuperFrag creates the i2o message to send the
	superfragment to the requestor. The feds are taken from fedData_,
	considering fedSize_. The fed headers and trailers are filled with
	meaningful content, including the same crc check
	(EventFilter/Utilities/inteface/Crc.h) performed online.
	* for randomely generated FED data, the parameter names have
	changed to fedSizeMean_ and fedSizeWidth_. useFixedSize_ is now
	useFixedFedSize_.
	* BU::buAllocateNMsg is now going to look for the presence of a
	static pointer to a PlaybackRawDataProvider, see
	EventFilter/Playback. If it is non zero, fed data is not going
	to be generated randomely but read from this interface, which
	retrieves the fed collection of events recorded in a file.
