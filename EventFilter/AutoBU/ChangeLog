2007-11-28  Marco Zanetti  <marco.zanetti@cern.ch>
		
	* tag V00-06-02
	* added possibility to overwrite event number in the fed headers. 
	This requires anyway the event number to be properly set in the GT payload

	the queue will otherwise be filled with RANDOM events at the
	beginning even in PLAYBACK mode.

	* fix potential dead-lock, avoid call to WebGUI::lockInfoSpaces()
	* add parameter 'firstEvent', specifying the number assigned to
	the first event in RANDOM mode.
	* add Monitor applications to all executives, add another
	executive for a collection Monitor (port 40003), and have flash
	lists generated by scripts/initialize. The Monitor collector needs
	to be activated over the webpage.

2007-04-27  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-10

	OutputModule(s) are still part of the configuration, but the EP
	property 'outputEnabled' is set to false.

2007-04-05  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-06

2007-03-30  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-03
	* improvements to scripts/initialize
	* the script detects now for all four packages if they are checked
	out locally or not
	* the '-playback' command line option can (must!) now be passed an
	argumnet, which is either a root file or an ASCII file with a list
	of root files

2007-03-29  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-02
	* add perl script 'scripts/initialize'
	* executing the script will start a complete AutoBU-RB-EP-SM
	system on the local machine
	* perl scripts 'configure', 'enable', 'stop', 'halt', and
	'destroy' are created as well. Execute them to control the system
	* destroy is actually going to remove any trace of your test,
	including the logs
	* command line options are:
	  -playback
	  -drop
	  -noSM
	  -host <machine.cern.ch>
	* the playback option will assume one playback file at
	/tmp/playback.root. In a future version, the file or list of files
	can be passed to the -playback option.

	* tag V00-04-01
	* fix fedSize generation according to Emilio's input concerning
	the correct way to generate a log-normal distribution
	* fix sync issue where an event could have actually been discarded
	before being added to the sentIds std::set before.

2007-03-27  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-00
	* pretty much rewrote the whole application
	* three different threads now for receiving requests, building
	events, and sending events
	* parameter 'dataBufSize' renamed 'msgBufferSize'
	* add class evf::BUEvent
	* events are (pre-) built in a queue
	* option 'replay': build the queue once, then keep rerunning on
	those events
	* option 'crc': do / don't calculate crc check
	* in PLAYBACK mode, I see a strange error in the
	BU_DISCARD_Callback. To be investigated
	
2007-03-26  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-03-02

	instead for monitoring (a la real BU)

2007-03-11  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-03-01

	* remove debug() method
	* remove check_event_data() method
	* fix stopTimer()/initTimer()
	* add BU::reset() to set all counters and non-counters to their
	'configured' state
	* verify that "configure - enable - halt - configure - enable"
	sequence is functional

2006-11-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-09
	* bug fix

2006-11-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-08
	* fix the way the internal fed buffers are filled in PLAYBACK
	mode. It wouldn't have worked for more than 64 feds (so it
	doesn't matter much for MTCC I/II data)
	

2006-11-24  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-07
	* protect call to 'postFrame' with a try/catch block and keep
	trying to post until it succeeds. Two new debug counters,
	nbPostFrame_ and nbPostFrameFailed_ keep track of this.

2006-11-22  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-06
	* add initTimer()/startTimer()/stopTimer
	methods. start The timer upon receiving the first request, not
	when enabling.
	* lock the thread when manipulating the variables used in the
	performance measurements, like nbBytes_.
	* rename bSem_ -> lock_. Add lock()/unlock() methods.

2006-11-09  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-05
	* fix bug regarding the FRL_LAST_SEGM flag not being set
	  appropriately in rare cases, spotted by Emilio
	* To distribute all valid feds among all superfragments, allow for
	  two different numbers of feds per superfragment. See
	  initFedBuffers(nFed), which is looking at (and possibly
	  changing!) nSuperFrag_ to distribute all FED Ids into
	  superfragments.

2006-11-03  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-04
	* add monitor parameters monitored by the 'real' BU
	* in "RANDOM" mode, only generate 'valid' FED IDs
	(DataFormats/FEDRawData/FEDNumbering); equaly distribute all valid
	FED IDs over superfragments. Don't use FED IDs which are 'left'
	due to the fact that nFEDs%nSF!=0.
	

2006-10-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-03

	* tag V00-02-02
	* turn nbMBPerSec_ from xdata::UnsignedInteger32 into a
	  xdata::Double

2006-10-23  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-01
	* fix memory leak: in playback mode, evf::BU must assume ownership
          of the FEDRawDataCollection received from the
	  PlaybackRawDataProvider and properly clean it up, which it now does.

2006-10-23  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-00
	* introduce namespace evf::
	* evf::BU is now a statemachine
	  (Configure - Enable - Halt, Suspend - Resume,
	  see EventFilter/Utilities/EPStateMachine)
	* evf::BU contains a WebGUI (see EventFilter/Utilities) to take
          care of managing exported parameters and displaying them on
	  HyperDAQ webpages
	* evf::BU measures the number of events and number of MB per
	  second sent
	* evf::BU listens to the *change* of the 'mode' parameter and
          intercepts it, as the mode of the module (RANDOM/PLAYBACK) is
	  (only!) automatically determined by the absence/presence of a
	  PlaybackRawDataProvider (see EventFilter/Playback).
	* changed the internal memory managment, fedData_ and fedSize_ are
	  now simpler data structures that are allocated only once
	

2006-09-26  Philipp Schieferdecker  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-01
	* bug fix: set buResourceId in message (value is irrelevant)

2006-09-26  Philipp Schieferdecker  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-00
	* fedData_ is a member of BU now; it is a vector of fed buffers,
	the length of each buffer is kept in fedSize_. Now, the fed header
	and trailer (and their sizes!) are included in fedData_ and
	fedSize_ (used to be payload only).
	* BU::createSuperFrag creates the i2o message to send the
	superfragment to the requestor. The feds are taken from fedData_,
	considering fedSize_. The fed headers and trailers are filled with
	meaningful content, including the same crc check
	(EventFilter/Utilities/inteface/Crc.h) performed online.
	* for randomely generated FED data, the parameter names have
	changed to fedSizeMean_ and fedSizeWidth_. useFixedSize_ is now
	useFixedFedSize_.
	* BU::buAllocateNMsg is now going to look for the presence of a
	static pointer to a PlaybackRawDataProvider, see
	EventFilter/Playback. If it is non zero, fed data is not going
	to be generated randomely but read from this interface, which
	retrieves the fed collection of events recorded in a file.
