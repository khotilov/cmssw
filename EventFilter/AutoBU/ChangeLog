	* fix memory leak: in playback mode, evf::BU must assume ownership
          of the FEDRawDataCollection received from the
	  PlaybackRawDataProvider and properly clean it up, which it now does.

	* tag V00-02-00
	* introduce namespace evf::
	* evf::BU is now a statemachine
	  (Configure - Enable - Halt, Suspend - Resume,
	  see EventFilter/Utilities/EPStateMachine)
	* evf::BU contains a WebGUI (see EventFilter/Utilities) to take
          care of managing exported parameters and displaying them on
	  HyperDAQ webpages
	* evf::BU measures the number of events and number of MB per
	  second sent
	* evf::BU listens to the *change* of the 'mode' parameter and
          intercepts it, as the mode of the module (RANDOM/PLAYBACK) is
	  (only!) automatically determined by the absence/presence of a
	  PlaybackRawDataProvider (see EventFilter/Playback).
	* changed the internal memory managment, fedData_ and fedSize_ are
	  now simpler data structures that are allocated only once

	* bug fix: set buResourceId in message (value is irrelevant)

	* fedData_ is a member of BU now; it is a vector of fed buffers,
	the length of each buffer is kept in fedSize_. Now, the fed header
	and trailer (and their sizes!) are included in fedData_ and
	fedSize_ (used to be payload only).
	* BU::createSuperFrag creates the i2o message to send the
	superfragment to the requestor. The feds are taken from fedData_,
	considering fedSize_. The fed headers and trailers are filled with
	meaningful content, including the same crc check
	(EventFilter/Utilities/inteface/Crc.h) performed online.
	* for randomely generated FED data, the parameter names have
	changed to fedSizeMean_ and fedSizeWidth_. useFixedSize_ is now
	useFixedFedSize_.
	* BU::buAllocateNMsg is now going to look for the presence of a
	static pointer to a PlaybackRawDataProvider, see
	EventFilter/Playback. If it is non zero, fed data is not going
	to be generated randomely but read from this interface, which
	retrieves the fed collection of events recorded in a file.
