2009-03-??  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V04-02-04
	* From David Dagenhard:  Added option that causes the Framework
	  statemachine to behave as if there is one event per input file
	  and go through new input file transitions before each event.
	  The purpose is to allow the output module to close output files
	  at any point. There is a restriction that output modules are allowed
	  to close output files and open new ones only when a new input file
	  is encountered.  This option is available to all streamer sources,
	  but is by default off except for the EventStreamHttpReader source.
	  This code change has no effect when the option turned off.  The
	  overhead introduced by the Framework itself is small, although it
	  will emit signals for the respondToOpenInputFile and
	  respondToCloseInputFile to modules which could potentially use
	  CPU or have other side effects.

2009-01-27  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* Improved fragment collection - allowed fragments out of order,
	  checked for duplicate fragments, checked for incomplete events.
	* Modified the DQM archive filenames to better match the format
	  used by the online consumers.
	* Added support for reconfigurations between runs.
	* Brought forward the additional event statistics from Harry.
	* Included the fix for the spurious discard messages sent to the
	  resource broker.
	* Converted the SM to use Python configuration files, and added
	  sample Python configuration files to test subdirectory.

2008-11-21  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	  match what is used in DQM archives created by event consumers.

2008-10-14  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V04-00-01

2008-10-14  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V04-00-00
	* Initial changes to support unique filter unit IDs.  Fixed a couple
	  of minor bugs in the FragmentCollector uncovered by running the

	* tag V03-14-19
	* Install performance statistics for stored data rates like for
	  received data rates. Changed the stored volume infospace variable
	  to actually give the stored volume and not the received data volume.

2008-10-12  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-18
	* Changed SMPerformanceMeter to use Kurt's counter classes and also
	  introduce a rate over a time period as well as a rate over a
	  given number of samples. Both are now given and the samples and
	  time period can be set in the SM XML xdaq config file (see sm_onenode.xml)
	  Also getting  and reporting statistics for received event sizes 
	  using a new counter class, still need to get the compression ratio
	  and fragment queue size when statistics gathering is moved to 
	  the FragmentCollector

2008-10-09  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-17
	* Added rcmsStateListener parameters to the SM application infospace
	  as requested by Hannes to support large configurations in the online.
	  Also, modified the sequence of operations at end run to correctly
	  assign file and event count statistics. This tag requires
	  EventFilter/Utilities V00-14-16.

2008-09-23  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-16
	* Reduced the number of copies of INIT messages kept in memory.
	  This should eliminate the out-of-memory crashes that we have
	  observed when testing with large numbers of filter units and
	  a large HLT configuration. (Crashes were seen when the RBSender
	  web page was visited and when multiple runs were started without
	  intervening destroy/configure transitions.)

2008-09-20  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-15
	* Added protection against NULL registry data pointers in 
	  StorageManager::receiveRegistryMessage().  Added clearing of the
	  SMFUSenderList in the enabling() method of StorageManager.
	  These changes will hopefully reduce or eliminate the occasional
	  crashes of the SM at the beginning of runs.

2008-09-16  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-14
	* Modified the INIT message handling in SMFUSenderEntry to handle
	  multiple INIT messages from the same RB.  Re-enabled the RBSender
	  web page.  Added partial fixes for the storedEvents problem at 
	  end run.  Added support for gracefully handling duplicate event
	  numbers when running with multiple AutoBUs.

2008-09-04  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-12
	* Modified the file closing logic so that it periodically tests whether files
	  need to be closed independent of whether events are being received or not.

2008-09-03  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-11

2008-09-01  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-09
	* Temporary solution for stored events statistics, gathered in workloop instead
	  and also removed temporarily the RB senders web page link that was causing
	  problems until we can reproduce it in a test setup

2008-08-27  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-08
	* Added variable reinitialization to the ServiceManager::stop() method.
	  With this change and a fix to clear the contents of the InitMsgCollection
	  in StorageManager::enabling(), hopefully the SM will correctly handle
	  Stop/Enable transitions (with regard to output file handling).

2008-08-22  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-07
	* Fixed bug in looping over output files.

2008-08-22  Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* tag V03-14-06
	* Rolled back the algorithm for closing files - it only depends on
	  a time interval with this change - there is no dependence on lumi
	  section number.

2008-08-18  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-03
	* Flashlist fixes: Uncommented fireItemAvailable of storedEvents in

	* Fix to lumi file closing and minor change to Error stream handling.

2008-08-13  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-00
	* Added the Error stream.  This included converting the StreamService and
	  OutputService classes into interfaces and creating derived classes for
	  handling regular events and FRDEvents (FED Raw Data Events) [which is a
	  more generic name for Error events].  This change depends on
	  IOPool/Streamer V05-02-00.

2008-08-13  William Tanenbaum <wmtan@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-13-00
	* Bug fix for a repacker problem. Due to the data dictionaries being loaded
	  too late, the repacker writes the raw data fully split, rather than unsplit,
	  as was specified in the dictionary.  This is not a critcal problem in that
	  the number of extra branches due to the splitting is small.  Nonetheless,
	  this fix should be picked up in 2_1_X, although it is not critical for 2_1_3.

2008-08-13  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-16
	* Backed out recent RB Sender web page changes until we've had a chance
	  to test them more.
	* Modified the use of the XDAQ Chrono class in SMPerformanceMeter to help
	  avoid negative statistics on monitor web pages.

2008-08-07  Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* tag V03-12-15
	* Fixes a flaw/bug in the way the lumi-section timeout is handled. 
	  Following the suggestion by Kurt the following is enforced:
	   1. The first flaw is that the LumiSectionTimeout is enforced against
	      the time that the last event arrived for LumiSection N instead of
	      the time of the arrival of the first event in LumiSection N+1.
	   2. The second flaw is that each stream keeps track of its own
	      starting point for the timeout rather than using a common value.
	  This is implemented by a modified version of
	  StreamService::closeTimedOutFiles() which is called by
	  ServiceManager::ManageEventMessage() for each stream.

2008-07-19  William Tanenbaum <wmtan@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-14
	* Critical fix for Streamer.  The streamer has not been kept up to date with
	  changes in the format of metadata, so it was not saving all of the metadata,
	  in particular, the Parameterset registry, Module Description registry,
	  EventHistory registry, and EntryDescription registry.  With this change, the
	  first two are saved in the header, while the data from the latter two are saved
	  not as registries, but event by event.

2008-07-17  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-13
	* Fixes from KB for scalar MEs (ints, floats, strings):  correctly determine ME
	  name; switched to using first instance when collating rather than last instance.

2008-07-03  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-12
	* Updated DQMHttpSource to take advantage of RawInputSource changes
	  (to correctly set the run and lumi numbers).
	* Removed unneeded TApplication attributed from DQMServiceManager.
	* Various (minor?) script changes from Constantin.

2008-06-25  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-11
	* Fixed bugs in DQM histogram serving and archiving.
	* Added archiveIntervalDQM configuration parameter to control how often
	  we archive DQM histograms (once every N lumi sections, where
	  archiveIntervalDQM = N).
	* Slightly modified format of DQM archive filenames.

2008-06-23 Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* Cleanup of the scripts subdirectories and modification of the scripts to
	  match what was run for Cruzet2 (full blown separate DB and new DB scheme 
          handling).  [from Constantin]
	* Modification of the EventServer to match what was run in
	  Cruzet2 (fair-share off, rates limited at the EventServer input, and 
	  events for consumers restricted to a single HLT output module).

	  running Workers (script jobs)

2008-05-12  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-02
	* Include a callback function to handle error events from resource broker with separate
	  I2O function code. Gave it a new ERROR_EVENT message code that requires
	  IOPool/Streamer tag hwkc20080512 (V04-34-01), this stops problems on receiving error
	  events, but the error events are not yet written out!

2008-05-11  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-01
	* Report storedEvents as actually stored events and not received events. Added reporting
	  of received events for each HLT output module, and stored events for each SM stream.

        * Check that output base path, mailbox path, and perl script files 
          actually exist during configure action, go into fail state if
          any of these do not exist.

	* tag V03-07-00
        * changes to move parameters out of streamer output modules and
          allow default values. So online parameters are in the SM XDAQ XML file
          while offline parameters have defaults and can be missing from the
          config file. The parameters common to all streams appear in the XML
          file, while each specific stay in the SM config file.
        * Change to allow the Storage Manager main thread to see the status of
          the FragmentCollector thread, and print out error messages for problems.
          Can later do cleanup and change to a fail state is desired.
