	* Added archiveIntervalDQM configuration parameter to control how often
	  we archive DQM histograms (once every N lumi sections, where
	  archiveIntervalDQM = N).
	* Slightly modified format of DQM archive filenames.

	* tag V03-12-09
	* Cleanup of the scripts subdirectories and modification of the scripts to
	  match what was run for Cruzet2 (full blown separate DB and new DB scheme 
          handling).  [from Constantin]
	* Modification of the EventServer to match what was run in
	  Cruzet2 (fair-share off, rates limited at the EventServer input, and 
	  events for consumers restricted to a single HLT output module).

	* tag V03-12-02
	* Include a callback function to handle error events from resource broker with separate
	  I2O function code. Gave it a new ERROR_EVENT message code that requires
	  IOPool/Streamer tag hwkc20080512 (V04-34-01), this stops problems on receiving error
	  events, but the error events are not yet written out!

2008-05-11  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-01

2008-02-02  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-09-02 
        * New version of SMPerformanceMeterfor thread safety so SMProxyServer can

2007-10-18  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-07-09

        * Check that output base path, mailbox path, and perl script files 
          actually exist during configure action, go into fail state if

	* tag V03-07-00
        * changes to move parameters out of streamer output modules and
          allow default values. So online parameters are in the SM XDAQ XML file
          while offline parameters have defaults and can be missing from the
          config file. The parameters common to all streams appear in the XML
          file, while each specific stay in the SM config file.
        * Change to allow the Storage Manager main thread to see the status of
          the FragmentCollector thread, and print out error messages for problems.
          Can later do cleanup and change to a fail state is desired.

2007-08-16  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>
