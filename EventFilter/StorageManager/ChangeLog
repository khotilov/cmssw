        * Check that output base path, mailbox path, and perl script files 
          actually exist during configure action, go into fail state if
          any of these do not exist.

	* tag V03-07-00
        * changes to move parameters out of streamer output modules and
          allow default values. So online parameters are in the SM XDAQ XML file
          while offline parameters have defaults and can be missing from the
          config file. The parameters common to all streams appear in the XML
          file, while each specific stay in the SM config file.
        * Change to allow the Storage Manager main thread to see the status of
          the FragmentCollector thread, and print out error messages for problems.
          Can later do cleanup and change to a fail state is desired.
