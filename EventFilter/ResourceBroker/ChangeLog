	* tag V00-01-01
	* add xdaq parameter 'doFedIdCheck' to FUResourceBroker, default
	is true, should be set to false if the processed events are known
	not to comply with the fedIds of the real CMS detector. This is
	e.g. the case for the eFEDs.

	* tag V00-01-00
	* add integer 'buIdToBeDiscarded_' and two binary semaphores to
	FUShmBuffer. Via the methods 'scheduleForDiscard()' and
	'buIdToBeDiscarded()', another thread can wait for a buId to be
	registered, access that number thread-safely, and send a discard
	to the builder unit.
	* the above mentioned 'other thread' is implemented as a WorkLoop
	in FUResourceTable. FUResourceTable is now in charge of all
	communication with the builder unit. the method 'workLoopAction()'
	contains the code which (in shm mode only!) discards the last
	event processed, checks if more events should be requested, and if
	so, send the request.
	* the FUResourceTable object of the FUResourceBroker is now
	attempted to be destroyed in 'haltAction'. This fails if other
	processes (the ShmReaders) are still attached to the shared memory
	segments.

	* tag V00-00-04
	* fixed stopTimer()/initTimer() (crashed before when configuring a
	second time).
	* add FUResourceTable::reset(), call it when configuring a second
	time.
	* add FUResourceBroker::reset(), to set all counters *and*
	non-counters to their 'configured' state

	* tag V00-00-03
	* add parameter 'eventBufferSize' to FUResourceBroker, default is
	'4194304' (4MB).

	* tag V00-00-02
	* check if new events should be allocated in 'timeExpired' to
	avoid synchronization problem in shm mode. debug counter
	nbTimeExpired counts how often this takes place.
	* add 'nbShmClients' monitor variable, indicates the number of
	connected clients (processors) in shm mode.
