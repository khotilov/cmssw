	* tag V00-06-09
	* fix stopping/halting
	* remove counter nbProcessed (is aequivalent to nbDiscarded, the

	* tag V00-06-08
	* fix 'nbShmClients()' calculation, which is now assuming that
	each process attaches 3x: reader,output,dqm.
	* If FUShmOutputModule and/or FUShmDQMOutputService are not
	present, 'halt' will fail!

2007-03-26  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-06-03
	* based on EventFilter/ShmBuffer V00-03-03, which provides some
	crucial fixes!
	* initialize nRecoCells_ and nDqmCells_ to 1, 0 currently not
	allowed!
	* the sendData and sendDqm threads are now cleanly exited upon
	halt/stop.

	* tag V00-06-00
	* based on EventFilter/ShmBuffer V00-03-00
	* based on EventFilter/Utilities V00-12-01
	* add SMProxy class to send (Event/DQM) data to the storage manager
	
2007-03-11  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-05-00
	* remove shmMode option: from now on, *only* FUShmReader is
	supported to consumer built events, the support of FUStdReader is
	stopped.
	* As a consequence, the FEDProvider interface is removed.
	* FUResourceTable::dropEvent() added.

2007-03-11  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-00

2007-02-24  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-01
	* add rcmsStateNotifier from xdaq2rc package: used to notify run
	control of the self-triggered transition into the target state.

2007-02-20  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-00
	* new asynchronous state model: upon receiving a command
	(e.g. 'configure'), a transitional state is entered; at
	the end of the transitional state (e.g. 'configuring'), the
	transition into the target state (e.g. 'ready') is
	auto-triggered.
	* missing: the run control function manager needs to be notified
	of the transition into the target state. This will be done using
	the xdaq2rc package, which will be part of xdaq in version
	3.8. Until xdaq 2.8. is part of the CMSSW release, this tag and
	following tags are not going to be published to the TC.
	* The stop and halt commands have been tested and verified to work
	well. After halt, the allocated shared memory will be released
	cleanly.
	

2007-02-12  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-02
	* add stopAction() to FUResourceBroker.
	* add shutDownClients() method to FUResourceTable: a bunch of
	empty events are going to be scheduled which indicate the
	FUShmReader to shut down operation.
	* if the FUEventProcessor is 'halted' *before* the Broker is
	halted, the allocated shared memory should be released now.

2007-01-18  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-01
	* add xdaq parameter 'doFedIdCheck' to FUResourceBroker, default
	is true, should be set to false if the processed events are known
	not to comply with the fedIds of the real CMS detector. This is
	e.g. the case for the eFEDs. 

2007-01-17  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-00
	* add integer 'buIdToBeDiscarded_' and two binary semaphores to
	FUShmBuffer. Via the methods 'scheduleForDiscard()' and
	'buIdToBeDiscarded()', another thread can wait for a buId to be
	registered, access that number thread-safely, and send a discard
	to the builder unit.
	* the above mentioned 'other thread' is implemented as a WorkLoop
	in FUResourceTable. FUResourceTable is now in charge of all
	communication with the builder unit. the method 'workLoopAction()'
	contains the code which (in shm mode only!) discards the last
	event processed, checks if more events should be requested, and if
	so, send the request.
	* the FUResourceTable object of the FUResourceBroker is now
	attempted to be destroyed in 'haltAction'. This fails if other
	processes (the ShmReaders) are still attached to the shared memory
	segments.

2006-11-29  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-00-04
	* fixed stopTimer()/initTimer() (crashed before when configuring a
	second time).
	* add FUResourceTable::reset(), call it when configuring a second
	time.
	* add FUResourceBroker::reset(), to set all counters *and*
	non-counters to their 'configured' state
	

2006-11-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-00-03
	* add parameter 'eventBufferSize' to FUResourceBroker, default is
	'4194304' (4MB).

2006-11-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-00-02
	* check if new events should be allocated in 'timeExpired' to
	avoid synchronization problem in shm mode. debug counter
	nbTimeExpired counts how often this takes place.
	* add 'nbShmClients' monitor variable, indicates the number of
	connected clients (processors) in shm mode.
	
2006-11-22  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>
