	panel
	* bug fix: VPSet.setValue() needed one.

	* fix bugs reported by Marco: insert another reference to an
	already referenced module instance; correct storage of VInputTag
	and VEventID datatypes; parameter value changes not reflected in
	the tree view in some cases; a tracked PSet can be empty (?!).
	* change DB schema to allow for an additional integer to be stored
	with each (path / sequence / module) *reference*, which indicates
	the operator to that reference ('&',',','!','-'). To be reflected
	in the datamodel.

	BranchDescription 
	* pick up converter changes: *V1.java files removed, ascii
	converter files now in src/confdb/converter/ascii; ConfigModifier
	and Converter.overrideEndpath() features; ',' -> '&' as operator
	between modules in SequenceWriter
	* add SoftwareRelease class to src/confdb/data. Hold collection of
	all software component templates of the current release
	* SoftwareRelease.clearInstances() is called in
	ConfDbGui.closeConfiguration() now, ensuring that if a release is
	kept in memory, all instances are properly cleaned up
	* Fix bug regarding the addition of a module to a sequence in the
	GUI
	* change the DB schemas, the data model, and the GUI to allow for
	Sequences in Sequences
	* Keep track of a configuration being changed since the last time
	saved, if yes, prompt the user if he is about to close it without
	saving the changes
	* Remove the strict naming convention for Modules, instead check
	for each Path/Sequence/Instance that the given name doesn't occur
	anywhere else. All restrictions on the parameters of different
	instances of the same type are lifted.
	* Add 'ValidatedNameDialog' to ESSource context menu, to allow for
	the insertion of several instances of the same ESSource

	* if 'input' is set in the Converter section of the
	ConfigurationPanel, a PoolSource with 'fileNames' parameter set
	according to input replaces any EDSource given in the
	configuration; the PoolSource should be inserted if no EDSource
	was present in the first place, but that isn't the case yet.
	* There are now four tabs on the left side: Tree, Ascii, Python,
	and Html

	* tag V00-00-03
	* Jonathan has checked in the first release of the parser. module
	to store in MySQL ready, Oracle module to follow. PSets/VPSets are
	handled.
	* changes to the database schema: The tables Services, EDSource,
	ESSources, SuperIdParameterAssoc, SuperIdParamSetAssoc, and
	SuperIdVerParamSetAssoc got an additional field 'sequenceNb' to
	indicate the order in which parameters are associated with their
	parent. This is important for VPSets, and possibly for PSets. If
	the order of Services matters isn't quite certain, but this way we
	avoid for them to appear in different orders in different
	sessions, which might be confusing.
	* The parser version is not compliant with that schema yet
	* the java database API and the data model can now deal with
	nested PSets. This hasn't been extensively tested yet.
