	* Jonathan has checked in the first release of the parser. module
	to store in MySQL ready, Oracle module to follow. PSets/VPSets are
	handled.
	* changes to the database schema: The tables Services, EDSource,
	ESSources, SuperIdParameterAssoc, SuperIdParamSetAssoc, and
	SuperIdVerParamSetAssoc got an additional field 'sequenceNb' to
	indicate the order in which parameters are associated with their
	parent. This is important for VPSets, and possibly for PSets. If
	the order of Services matters isn't quite certain, but this way we
	avoid for them to appear in different orders in different
	sessions, which might be confusing.
	* The parser version is not compliant with that schema yet
	* the java database API and the data model can now deal with
	nested PSets. This hasn't been extensively tested yet.
