startGUI script:
----------------

The following steps are necessary to setup the startGUI script to work

cd /path/to/CMSSW_X_Y_Z/src
eval `scramv1 runtime -[c]sh`
cvs co EventFilter/ConfigDB
cd EventFilter/ConfigDB
./startGUI

Once you have checked out the ConfigDB package, you can execute the
script from any place you want, *if* you have executed the "eval
`scramv1 runtime -[c]sh`" command beforehand!
