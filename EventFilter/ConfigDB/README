Database Driver Installation
----------------------------

(1) MySQL
 ---------

 To connect to a MySQL database, one needs the appropriate JDBC driver
(jar file) in the classpath. The one currently being used is

mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar

It can be downloaded from

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j

(2) Oracle
----------

To connect to an Oracle Database, one needs the appropriate JDBC
driver (jar file) in the classpath. The one currently being used is
called

ojdbc14.jar

It can be found as part of any Oracle Installation in

$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ or $ORACLE_HOME/java

It can also be downlaoded from

http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html


startGUI script:
----------------

The following steps are necessary to setup the startGUI script to work
(the $MYSQL_HOME variable should hopefully be setup by scramv1 in the
future):

cd $HOME
mkdir java
cp mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar java
setenv MYSQL_HOME ${HOME}

cd /path/to/CMSSW_X_Y_Z/src
eval `scramv1 runtime -[c]sh`
cvs co EventFilter/ConfigDB
cd EventFilter/ConfigDB
./startGUI

Once you have checked out the ConfigDB package, you can execute the
script from any place you want, *if* you have executed the "eval
`scramv1 runtime -[c]sh`" command beforehand!
