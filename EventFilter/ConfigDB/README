Database Driver Installation
----------------------------

(1) MySQL
 ---------

 To connect to a MySQL database, one needs the appropriate JDBC driver
(jar file) in the classpath. The one currently being used is called

mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar

It can be downloaded from

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j

(2) Oracle
----------

To connect to an Oracle Database, one needs the appropriate JDBC
driver (jar file) in the classpath. The one currently being used is
called

ojdbc14.jar

It can be found as part of any Oracle Installation in

$ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/

It can also be downlaoded from

http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html


NOTE:
-----

I have found it to be convenient to copy these drivers into
$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext, which will make them appear in the classpath
automatically. If there is a technical reason why this is not a good
idea, let me know: philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch
