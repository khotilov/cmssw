<h1>ConfDB GUI</h1>
<h3>You have two options to start the Java ConfDB GUI:</h3>
<h3>click <a href="start.jnlp">here</a> to start the Java Web Start version</h3>
<ul>
<li>advantages:
<ul>
<li>you are automatically running the latest version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>disadvantages:
<ul>
<li><b>might not work at all!</b><br>With the recent upgrades of JavaWebStart security restrictions have been tightened on several platforms. 
 You can lift these restrictions but it's probably easier to use method 2 to start the GUI
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>click <a href="confdb-gui-all-inclusive.jar">here</a> to download an executable jar file which includes all classes needed. </h3>
Double-clicking the downloaded jar file should start the GUI on many platforms.<br>
If not, start the GUI on a command line by entering:<br>
<pre>java -jar confdb-gui-all-inclusive.jar</pre><br>
in the directory where the jar file can be found
<ul>
<li>advantages:
<ul>
<li>you can run the GUI locally like any other (Java) program  
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>it takes longer to start the GUI if you download the jar file each time you want to run the program</li>
<li>you might not run the latest version if you do not download the jar file each time you start the GUI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
