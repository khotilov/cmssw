I. For validation of clusterization the CluFP420Test.cc 
is used: 

a) with Hector transport, EDDE events

  1) execute command:

  cmsRun runTest1.cfg
  ( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

  2) execute 

  root -b clus.C
  ( to see the plots: ggv clus.ps)


b) with Hector transport, MinBias Pythia events

  1) execute command:

  cmsRun runTest2.cfg
  ( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

  2) execute 

  root -b test.C
  ( to see the plots: ggv test.ps)


b) w/o Hector transport, inline Gun

  1) execute command:

  cmsRun runTestCl.cfg
  ( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

  2) execute 

  root -b clus.C
  ( to see the plots: ggv clus.ps)

II. For validation of tracking the RecFP420Test.cc 
is used:

a) with Hector transport, EDDE events (ejob)

  1) execute command:

    cmsRun runFP420Test.cfg   (ejob)
    ( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

  2) execute 

    root -b track.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv track.C)
    root -b clus.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv clus.ps)
    root -b track3D.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv track3D.C)

b) with Hector transport,  MinBias Pythia events (ajob), (fjob)

  1) execute command:

    cmsRun runFP420Test2.cfg
    cmsRun runFP420Test22.cfg read input root file w/ MinBias Pythia events
    cmsRun runFP420Test2a.cfg (ajob)
    cmsRun runFP420Test2f.cfg (fjob)
    ( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

  2) execute 

    root -b track.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv track.C)
    root -b clus.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv clus.ps)
    root -b track3D.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv track3D.C)

c) with Hector transport,  inline Gun  (job3)

  1) execute command:

    cmsRun runFP420Test3.cfg   (job3)
    cmsRun runFP420Test32.cfg   two inline protons (job32)
    ( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

  2) execute 

    root -b talks.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv talks.C)
    root -b track.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv track.C)
    root -b clus.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv clus.ps)
    root -b track3D.C
    ( to see the plots: ggv track3D.C)

III. For validation of tracking w/o Hector transport 
===========================================
the RecFP420Test.cc is also used:  (inline Gun)

1) execute command:

cmsRun run3DTest.cfg    (ijob)
cmsRun run3DTest2.cfg    two inline protons  (ijob2)
( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

2) execute 

root -b track3D.C
root -b zz3.C
( to see the plots: ggv track3D.C)
