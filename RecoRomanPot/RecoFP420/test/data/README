I. To check clusterization use: (with Hector transport, EDDE events)

1) execute command:

cmsRun runTest1.cfg
( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

2) execute 

root -b clus.C
( to see the plots: ggv zz1.ps)

II. To check tracking use:  (with Hector transport, EDDE events)

1) execute command:

cmsRun runFP420Test.cfg
( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

2) execute 

root -b track.C
( to see the plots: ggv track.C)
===========================================
===========================================
III. To check tracking use:  (w/o transport, inline Gun)

1) execute command:

cmsRun run3DTest.cfg
( TheAnalysis.root will be produced) 

2) execute 

root -b track3D.C
( to see the plots: ggv track3D.C)
3) see comments to III. below.

comments to III.
================
To check the match of XZ and YZ projections of the same track 
 - see plot 34 in track.C: mintheta,mintheta2,minthetay,minthetay2
 - for running in run3DTest.cfg use {2212,2212} and 
in RecFP420Test.C use:

	if ( thePrim != 0  && ZZZ420 != -999999.
	     && ((xref  > -25. && xref  < -5.) && (yref  > -5. && yref  < 5.))  
	     && ((xref2 > -25. && xref2 < -5.) && (yref2 > -5. && yref2 < 5.))  
	     && dref12 > 1.0 && drefy12 > 1.0       
	     ) {
............................................................	  
	          unsigned int clnumcut=1;// ask 2 tracks

IV. Clarifying to use track reconstruction methods:
----------------------------------------------
!!! Default is: 
"TrackProducerSophisticatedFP420" with NumberFP420SPTypes = 3 !!!
----------------------------------------------

1. "TrackProducerMaxAmplitudeFP420"; 
- can be used for case of one track in the detector;
- planes with narrow pixels used in the fit only: 
        it is implied that with X type planes one defines 
x-track parameters, and with Y type planes - y-track ones;
- the next options of NumberFP420SPTypes are possible:
          = 3 - X and Y planes are available 

2. "TrackProducerMaxAmplitude2FP420"; 
- can be used for case of one track in the detector;
- all planes(with narrow and wide pixels) used in the fit; 
- the next options of NumberFP420SPTypes are possible: 
          = 1 - Y planes are available only 
          = 2 - X planes are available only 
          = 3 - X and Y planes are available 

3. "TrackProducerSophisticatedFP420"; 
- can be used for any number of tracks in the detector;
- finder based on narrow pixels, 
- the next options of NumberFP420SPTypes are possible: 
    = 1 - Y planes are available only: take for other projection just result of fit for wide pixels;
    = 2 - X planes are available only :take for other projection just result of fit for wide pixels;
    = 3 - X and Y planes are available simultaneously: do match of projection based on comparison 
                                         of track parameters obtained from narrow and wide pixels;
    = 4 - X and Y planes are available simultaneously: (not available yet)
                                   -finder for wide pixels use track obtained with narrow pixel;
                                   -all planes(with narrow and wide pixels) finally used in the fit;

4. "TrackProducer3DFP420";  (not available yet)
- can be used for any number of tracks in the detector;
- finder based on narrow and wide pixels simultaneously, 
- the next options of NumberFP420SPTypes are possible: 
          = 1 - Y planes are available only 
          = 2 - X planes are available only 
          = 3 - X and Y planes are available
