\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Place for SteppingHelixPropagator: a propagator using a simplified geometry/material treatment.


\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

SteppingHelixPropagator
- ::propagate(FTS, Cylinder) and ::propagate(FTS, Plane) methods are avialable through
 Propagator abstract base class interface.

- FTS  ::propagate(FTS, GlobalPoint) provides extrapolation to PCA to a point (useful for vertexing)
- FTS  ::propagate(FTS, GlobalPoint, GlobalPoint) provides extrapolation to PCA to a line (e.g., beamline)
The above two methods are only available as members of SteppingHelixPropagator class 
(not through Propagator class interface).

Note that the propagator can be configured to propagate
-# alongMomentum -- the direction of propagation is along momentum
-# oppositeToMomentum -- the direction of propagation is opposite to momentum
-# anyDirection -- the direction is estimated internally as the direction of the shorter distance
to the destination point.

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->
src/SteppingHelixPropagatorESProducer .. with module.cc -- provide a preconfigured 
S.H.Propagator through the event setup
test/SteppingHelixPropagatorAnalyzer .. see below.

To use a pre-configured extrapolator user is advised to access
the propagator via event setup, e.g., 
  ESHandle<Propagator> shPropAlong;
  iSetup.get<TrackingComponentsRecord>().get("SteppingHelixPropagatorAlong", shPropAlong);
which will provide a preconfigured propagator with propagation direction along momentum.
The corresponding config include file is 
TrackPropagation/SteppingHelixPropagator/data/SteppingHelixPropagatorAlong.cfi .
The other (suffix) options are "Any" and "Opposite" (see above for definitions).


\subsection configuration Configuration files for access through ES
The .cfi file names (base) correspond to the ComponentName value
- \b SteppingHelixPropagatorAlong.cfi : propagate "alongMomentum"
- \b SteppingHelixPropagatorOpposite.cfi : propagate "oppositeToMomentum"
- \b SteppingHelixPropagatorAny.cfi : choose propagation direction based on a straight-line quess from inState to destSurface ("anyDirection")

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
SteppingHelixPropagatorAnalyzer.cc can be used to produce ntuples of MC hit matching.
testPropagatorAnalyzer.cfg and .sh files help runnig the Analyzer
MuProp.h and .C files correspond to (compileable) root scripts for making analyzis of the ntuple.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Still in development.
Muon swimming is working fine.
Decent quality error propagation is also implemented.
Radiation length non-additive (1+0.036*log(x)) effects relevant to multiple scattering 
are optionally accounted assuming the path integral at the starting point is zero.
Note that accounting for it is configured by default if the propagator is extracted from event setup.
This effect can be handled properly if using (local to SteppingHelixPropagator only) interface with SteppingHelixStateInfo.
The errors in the cov matrix due to multiple scattering appear to be good to within a few percent.
Since the tails of Eloss fluctuations are not accounted for (not a Gaussian part), 
the distributions of the matching values might be wider than predicted from naive model of Gaussian errors.
