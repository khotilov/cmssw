\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Still in development.
Muon swimming is working fine.
Decent quality error propagation is also implemented.
Radiation length non-additive (1+0.036*log(x)) effects relevant to multiple scattering 
are not accounted for mostly due to missing interface of the basic class.
This results in an underestimate of relevant errors, significant for large X/X0:
15 to 20% if going from (0,0,0) to the outer muon chambers.
