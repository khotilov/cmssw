\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Place for SteppingHelixPropagator: a propagator using a simplified geometry/material treatment.


\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

SteppingHelixPropagator


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->
src/SteppingHelixPropagatorESProducer .. with module.cc -- provide a preconfigured 
S.H.Propagator through the event setup
test/SteppingHelixPropagatorAnalyzer .. see below.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
SteppingHelixPropagatorAnalyzer.cc can be used to produce ntuples of MC hit matching.
testPropagatorAnalyzer.cfg and .sh files help runnig the Analyzer
MuProp.h and .C files correspond to (compileable) root scripts for making analyzis of the ntuple.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Still in development.
Muon swimming is working fine.
Decent quality error propagation is also implemented.
Radiation length non-additive (1+0.036*log(x)) effects relevant to multiple scattering 
are optionally accounted assuming the path integral at the starting point is zero.
Some additions to the  interface of the base (Propagator) class might've halped to handle
this better.
The errors in the cov matrix due to multiple scattering appear to be good to within a few percent.
Since the tails of Eloss fluctuations are not accounted for (not a Gaussian part), 
the distributions of the matching values might be wider than predicted from naive model of Gaussian errors.
