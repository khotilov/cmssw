	  log -> std::log and exp -> std::exp for slc4/gcc3.4.5 compliance.

	* tag V00-03-00
	* change interface of DaqBaseReader: pass a pointer reference (not
	a reference) to fillRawData() in order to allow for an allready
	existing collection to be passed. Traditional Readers will have to
	call data=new FEDRawDataCollection() within fillRawData().
	* adjust DaqFakeReader to the interface change above
	* adjust DaqSource to the interface change above
	* [EventFilter/FUReader *is* a DaqBaseReader and is adjusted as
	well!]
