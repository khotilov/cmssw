--[ Intro ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

Each SiStrip Run Summary flag has two implementations (classes):

  - TXT 
  - XML

The reason of separation is limitation of boost/serialization library.

TXT  Flags that will be automatically serialized in text format.
XML   -- " --                 -- " --               XML format.

SerializeTxt, SerializeBin, SerializeXML are manager classes that should be
used for serialization purposes of the whole tree.

--[ Dependencies ]-------------------------------------------------------------

Library                 Version

boost/serialization     >= 1.31.1
CGICC                   >= 5.0.1

--[ ./bin/ ]-------------------------------------------------------------------

Contains examples of how to work with SiStrip Run Summary Flags:

  main_all.cc    Convert TXT based Flags to XML and vice versa
  main_bin.cc    Save TXT Flags in binary streams such as string, file. Any 
                 other may be used in the same way.
  main_cgicc.cc  CGICC module for WEB server that fills Flags with values
  main_txt.cc    The same as main_bin.cc but saves Flags in Test stream
  main_xml.cc    Save Flags in XML format... Output is written to any stream:
                 string, file, etc.

--[ SiStripRunSummaryWrite ]---------------------------------------------------

Read SiStrip Run Summary Flags tree from external XML file and save them in DB
in form of regular string as a SiStripRunSummary Record.

Input:  XML file that contains serialized SiStrip Run Summary flags tree. This
        file can be created by running main_xml.cc file placed in 

          CalibTracker/SiStripRunSummary/bin/

        ]
Output: test.db, test.xml files that specify DB written data

--[ SiStripRunSummaryRead ]----------------------------------------------------

Read SiStrip Run Summary Flags from DB and print them out on a screen.

Input: test.db, test.xml files that were created by SiStripRunSummaryWrite
       module
