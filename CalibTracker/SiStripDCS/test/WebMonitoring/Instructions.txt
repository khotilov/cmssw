The scripts in this directory allow to setup a web monitoring of the HV
power status of the SiStrip Tracker.
The information is read from a DCS tag in the offline database and is
saved in a json format accepted by the web page. It requires the flot
package which is not committed here, but can be downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/flot/. Everything was tested with flot version 0.6.

Note that the web part is very generic and can be used to display trend
plots of any quantity. The only requirement is a json file in the suitable
format.

The RunCheckAllIOVs.sh script does the following:
- dumps the content of all IOVs of the DCS tag in log files
- runs the DCSTrend.py macro to generate the json file with all the values
- runs the DCSLastTrend.py macro which produces the json file for the last
month of data.
