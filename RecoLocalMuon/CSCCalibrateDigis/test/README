Here are the steps to follow to run the calibration from your ~username/scratch0/ space.

Aug 11, 2006: The calibration package has now been successfully tested in CMSSW_0_9_0_pre3.
              Pool Convert now works on the CSCUnpacker, hence the procedure is now much easier.

1) Checkout the code from CVS and compile:
      cd ~/scratch0
      scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_0_9_0_pre3
      cd CMSSW_0_9_0_pre3/src/
      cvs co RecoLocalMuon/CSCCalibrateDigis
      cd RecoLocalMuon/CSCCalibrateDigis
      scramv1 b
      cd test/

2) Setup parameters for using the oracle database to be set to have access to the database:
      eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`
      scramv1 setup -i oracle < oracle.setup
      source ~dfortin/public/input_for_csc_oracle/.setoracle
 
3) Finally, you are ready to run the calibration ! 
      eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`
      cmsRun -p CSCCalibDigis.cfg

Note: You may need to change the location of the input/output file as the
      output file may be huge if you run on all events (> 1 GB).
      So you may want to edit CSCCalibDigis.cfg.
