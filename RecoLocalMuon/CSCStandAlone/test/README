####################### This is a list of Standalone tracking software available ###########

1) Set up a CMSSW area. At time of this writing, everything has been tested in CMSSW_0_6_0, 
   the latest stable release.

2) Check out RecoLocalMuon/CSCStandAlone. There is a copy of ALL files in the /src, however the 
   header files using in compiling are in /interface. The BuildFile and relevent configuration
   files are in /test.

3) You MUST copy the .so files for reading in the calibration constants from the database. They are 
   located at:
	http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/CSC/CERN/dbc_library/   (copy: libcondbc.so)
        http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/CSC/CERN/cscmap_library/    (copy: libcscmap.so)
   They must be placed in your /CMSSW_x_x_x/lib/slc3_ia32_gcc323/ area.

4) If you wish to use the event display, then in the area in which you wish to run the software 
  (recommended: /CSCStandAlone/test) you must make a directory called "disp". This gives the program
   a place to save the .root files.

5) Compile from /CSCStandAlone/test.

6) Here is what the software does:

	a)CSCMonitoring.cc (run from CSCMonitor.cfg) creates file CSCMonitoring.root. This contains
	26+ histograms for the (eventual) 36 odd chambers in the Slice Test / MTCC. These histograms
	cover various efficiency aspects, etc. It also creates the "empty" file trkdump.dat. This
	can be ignored.

	b)CSCEventDisplay.cc (run from CSCEventDisplay.cfg) goes event-by-event and looks for
	tracks through the endcap. Prints the display to the screen, as well as saves it in the
	"disp" directory (see 4). It also creates tmp.dat.This should be ignored.

	c)CSCTrackLink.cc (run from CSCTrackLink.cfg) creates 2 files-trklink.dat and CSCTrackLink.root.
	This programs finds tracks through 2 chambers. The columns of trklink.dat are:
	Chamber ID1, Cathode Slope1, Cathode Intercept1, Anode Slope1, Anode Intercept1,
	Chamber ID2, Cathode Slope2, Cathode Intercept2, Anode Slope2,and  Anode Intercept2.
	The .root file contains these same values as "leaves" on the root tree.

        d)RecHitCom.cc (run from rechit.cfg) compares the hits found by the standalone tracking program 
          to CSCRecHit. Right now the program only runs on chamber 2/2/27, and if you wish to change that, will
          require a recompile. I merely wanted this backed up somewhere. 

These programs are intended for use with Global DAQ data available from CASTOR in
/castor/cern.ch/cms/emuslice/globaldaq. 

Should you find any problems feel free to let me know.
