 * Fast fit adc values to                                     			  <BR>
 *    N*(p0**2/256/exp(-4))*(t-t0)**4*exp(-p0*(t-t0))				  <BR>

 * PulseTime has peaking time fixed to 133 nsec.				  <BR>
 * It actually fits for the t0                                                    <BR>

 * Fit the log of data                                                     	  <BR>
 *                      chi2=(log(Data)-log(N)-4*log(t-t0)+p0*(t-t0))**2	  <BR>
 *                                                                                <BR>
 * Becomes least square fit in p0 and log(N); and binary search in t0             <BR>
 * yields N, p0, t0(nsec)				                          <BR>
 *										  <BR>
 * Note: tpeak=4/p0 (nsec) and adc[0] is arbitrarily defined a time of 0.0 nsec.  <BR>
 *                                                                                <BR>
 * Finally, a fit to the charge deposition for each time bin is performed using   <BR>
 * the fitted t0.                                                                 <BR>
