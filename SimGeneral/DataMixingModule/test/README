skeletal instructions - will update later

step1: find two files you would like to overlay

step2: execute the DataMixingModule
- checkout SimGeneral/DataMixingModule and cd to it's test directory
- in the test directory, change in data/mm.cfg the name of the input file to 
  your "signal" file.
- in the plugins directory, change mixOne.cfi so that it contains the name of
  the second "background" file.
- do cmsRun mm.cfg - you should get a TestMix.root file.

step3: verify the result (not ready yet)
