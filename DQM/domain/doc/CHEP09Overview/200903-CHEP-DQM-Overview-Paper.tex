\begin{abstract}
In the last two years the CMS experiment has commissioned a full end
to end data quality monitoring system in tandem with progress in the
detector commissioning.  We present the data quality monitoring and
certification systems in place, from online data taking to delivering
certified data sets for physics analyses, release validation and
offline re-reconstruction activities at Tier-1s.  We discuss the main
results and lessons learnt so far in the commissioning and early
detector operation.  We outline our practical operations arrangements
and the key technical implementation aspects.
