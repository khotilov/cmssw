# Simple counting experiment, with one signal and a few background processes 
# Extremely simplified version of the 35/pb H->WW analysis for mH = 200 GeV,
# for 4th generation exclusion.
# You should get an observed limit of ~0.67 times the 4G cross section, as is
# in the table 6 of the paper EWK-10-009 (arxiv:1102.5429v1)
# Also, the mean expected limit should be ~1.06 times the 4G cross section.
imax 1  number of channels
jmax 1  number of backgrounds 
kmax 2  number of nuisance parameters (sources of systematical uncertainties)
------------
# we have just one channel, in which we observe 0 events
bin         1
observation 0
------------
# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# then we list the systematical uncertainties, and list the effect for each process and bin
