zratio34.C     - analysis of "bad" channels for which maximum of LED signal is away from TS3+4 and

zRunRatio34.C  - rates of these "bad" channels as function of iRun and
zRunNbadchan.C - average number of these "bad" channels as function of iRun

zrms.C         - analysis of "bad" channels for which width of LED signal is away from mean RMS

zcalib.C       - analysis of "bad" calibration channels w/ maximum of LED signal outside normal position

zgain.C        - relative difference of channel response, collected over all TS, in 2 LED runs. 
                Aim: to see > 5(2?)% change to start PMT/HPD gain tuning (for HB, HE, HO, HF )
zdifampl.C     - relative difference of channel response with pedestal subtraction, collected in TS34, 
                in 2 LED runs. 
                Aim: to see > 5(2?)% change to start PMT/HPD gain tuning(for HB depth1,2 & HE depth1,2,3)

zerrors.C      - analysis of CapIdErrors using global NZS runs
