Must be at SLC4 machine with access /bigspool/usc (with local HCAL runs)

To get HF SinglePhotoElectron PMT responses:

source runHFLightCal.csh <6-digit run number> [(optional) <number of events>]

Output with information for each HF channel:
hf_LightCal<run number>.root
hf_LightCal<run number>.txt

- if <run> is the properly taken low intensity HF LED/Laser run,
the HFPreLightCal code finds signal time position in TS,
then HFLightCal code gets linearized ADC amplitude spectra and fits 
them with pedestal + one-PE + two-PE function and obtains
SinglePhotoElectron PMT responses +/- errors, (ref: CMS IN 2007/018)

- if <run> is the high intensity HF LED/Laser run,
the same code roughly estimates (usually overestimates) SPE responses,
then errors on SPE are set to zeros

- if <run> is the pedestal HF run,
the same code performs attempt to get SPE responses by fitting (useless).

- in all cases, light intensity in PEs is estimated, 
and analysis of HF performance is provided.

Additional code HFLightCalRand:

source runHFLightCalRand.csh <6-digit run number> [(optional) <number of events>]

Output with information for each HF channel:
hf_LightCalRand<run number>.root
hf_LightCalRand<run number>.txt

-performs same job(s), but signal time position in TS is found in each
event as maximal 4 capIDs.
Less precise - useful when signal comes in random time, for example for 
light leak searching with a pedestal run.
