# Michael Case 2009-09-17:  This is meant to validate that the geometry going into the db is
# indeed the same as the geometry that comes from the many xml files which created the db.
# It does NOT check SpecPars (yet).
# It checks the position of all parts in the hierarchy of the graph of parts positioned
# in the detector and is currently (in the file testCompareDumpFiles.py) set to look
# for differences exceeting .0004 mm in x, y and z and .0004 in the elements of the
# rotation matrix.
