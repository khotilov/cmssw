\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package implements the electronics simulation for all HCAL
subsystems: HB, HE, HO, & HF.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

The parameters are mostly gotten from the calibration
database.  As of this writing, the pedestal values are:
HB, HE, HO:  X +- X
HF:          x +- x

and the gains are:
HB, HE:  X GeV/LSB (+/- x %)


The sampling factor, the ratio of incling energy to sim-hit energy
is 117 in HB/HE, and 217 in HO.  In HF, the SimHit units are photoelectrons.

The photostatistics factor is 200 pe/deposited GeV in HB/HE, and 400 in HF.

The amplifier gain, which goes from photoelectrons to fC, is
calculated using units: pe/fC = (pe/depositedGEV) * (depositedGeV/ inc GeV) * (GeV/fC),
= photostat * sampling fraction * gain


\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

The HcalDigitizerTest is meant to be a standalone
test of the digitization chain.


\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->

 Stable
