\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides the electronics simulation for the ECAL and preshower
subsystems.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

The EcalElectronicsSim takes as input the analog signal it got
from the CaloHitResponse, in units of photoelectrons.
It applies a factor (from the SimParameterMap) to convert the
signal to fC, and passes it to the EcalCoder

The EcalCoder adds a pedestal and noise, each obtained
through a calibration database interface.  However,
for the time being, we have these numbers hardcoded
in the EcalDigiProducer as 40 MeV.


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->


\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->


\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
