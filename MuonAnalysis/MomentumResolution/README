The extra resolution smearing parameter and the scale factor are computed in two steps:

1. Generate MC and data samples. In test/ZMM (test/WPLUS, test/WMINUS), 
   configure ZMuMuNTupleCreator_MC.py (WMuNuNTupleCreator_MC.py) and run. 
   Do the same with ZMuMuNTupleCreator_Data.py (WMuNuNTupleCreator_Data.py). 
   This will create two NTuples with names EdmZmmTreeData.root (EdmWmnTreeData.root) 
   and EdmZmmTreeMC.root (EdmWmnTreeMC.root), or with the names that you assigned 
   in the configuration file if you changed the defaults.
 
2. Configure ZMuMuResAnalyzer.py with the input files (the ones from point 1) 
   and your preferences for the fit. The output is ResultsZMuMu.root (
   ResultsWMuNu.root). It contains two Canvases: cScan (with a plot if doscan 
   is true) and cZmass (with a plot if doscan is false).

NOTE: Usually running over NTuples takes some time. If you are going to run the 
      code several times it could be better to convert the EdmNTuple files into 
      a histogram (for data) and a tree (for MC). To do so, configure the file 
      EdmToTreeConverter.py and run over the Edm ntuples. To use the tree instead 
      of the ntuple, in the ZMuMuResAnalyzer (WMuNuResAnalyzer) file just change 
      to False the variable EdmNtuple in the process fit.
