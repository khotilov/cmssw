This package contains two python scripts and a RooFit macro that can be used to generate a background function binned in eta
for the J/Psi.

RunAllEtaBins.py runs MuScleFit over all the bins specified therein (bins of (eta_mu1, eta_mu2) to take into account correlations)
to produce the plots (1 iteration without any fit).
It then runs the macro CrystalBallFitOnData_JPsi.cc to fit the background.
Look in RunAllEtaBins.py for more detailed instructions.

After this, you can run BuildBackgrounFunction.py to produce the code of the function to be inserted in Functions.h
