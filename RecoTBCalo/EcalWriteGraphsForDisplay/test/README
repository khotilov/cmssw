**** you can use these programs to look at the 10 samples of a n X m window of crystals
     for a certain number of events

- in: RecoTBCalo/EcalWriteGraphsForDisplay/test

- eval `scramv1 ru -csh`

- use WriteGraphs.cfg or WriteGraphsPool.cfg, if the raw data input file is binary is respectively
  binary or root-pool

- edit the conf file you have chosen and set:

    - the path and file_name of the raw data file
      untracked   vstring fileNames = {'file:/data/h4tb//H4B-000011383-SM22-LASER-STD'}

    -   choose where you want to center the n X m matrix of crystals you want to look at
        and chose the window size as well
        untracked string crystal = "850"
        untracked double nx =  3.
        untracked double ny =  3.
    
     NOTE: the crystal number in the config file is a string

    - consider that an intermediate file containing TGraphs will be written with 
      a name that you can choose:
      untracked string rootfile = "graphs.root"

- cmsRun WriteGraphs.cfg
  (or: cmsRun WriteGraphsPool.cfg)

- now you have the file "graphs.root" and you can use two simple root macroes to display the content.
  Lanch root from RecoTBCalo/EcalWriteGraphsForDisplay/test, and issue the commands:

		[pctorino1] ~/debugging/CMSSW_0_8_0/src/RecoTBCalo/EcalWriteGraphsForDisplay/test > root -l
		root [0] .L ToBeLoaded.C
		root [1] .x InteractiveDisplay.C
		filename:
		graphs.root
		Xtal: 850
		width: 3
		height: 3
