Timing of a new supermodule.

***********************************************************************************************
Step 1): equalize the 68 TTs with the laser

1-a) Take a laser run (run: 12345)

1-b) from RecoTBCalo/EcalTBTiming/test  run
     eval `scramv1 ru -csh`
     TimingLaser.sh 12345
     This will produce the files:
     TimingLaser_12345.root
     TTPeakPositionFileLaser_12345.txt
     ChPeakTimeLaser_12345.txt

     You can check the alignement of the TT by looking in the root file the histogram:
     histos/relative_TT_timing . It gives the relative timing between the TTs in sample units.
     If you see a difference between the two SM halves in others histograms or profile in the 
     root file you should not be worried. 
     Maybe one can check that the amplitudes are well below 4000 (ampl_prof_conv_1)
     
1-c)  
     copy from /etc/daq/delays/ the xml file that was used when 
     run 12345 was taken
     (e.g cp /etc/daq/delays/sm_XX.xml ./init_smXX.xml )

1-d) Produce a new delay xml file better equalized: (from test)
     ./ProduceRelTimeOffsetFileCMSSWNew.exe init_smXX.xml ../TTPeakPositionFileLaser_12345.txt time_offsets_smXX_after12345 
     (not time_offsets_smXX_after12345.xml ) 
     This will produce a new xml file:
     time_offsets_smXX_after12345.xml
     This file has to be copied to /etc/daq/delays/ and linked
     in /etc/daq/delays/  type  ln -fs time_offsets_smXX_after12345.xml sm_XX.xml

     Note: if in the laser run not all the TT were active you will receive complains from ./ProduceRelTimeOffsetFileCMSSWNew.exe
     The towers not found will have the same offsets in the old and new xml file.

1-e) Redo from 1-a to 1-d untile the RMS of the TTs in 1-b) is about  0.015 (samples)

     Usually it takes 2 or 3 iterations to get the proper timing
     suppose that time_offsets_smXX_after12347.xml is the good one.
 
**********************************************************************************************************************************

Step 2) Create the timing file for the beam. 

     This is needed to take into account the difference in travel time of the laser light 
     and the electrons.

     From test type:
     ./ShiftTimeFromFileNew.exe time_offsets_smXX_after12347.xml TimeCorrectionLaserTB.ttxt time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v0
     (again not time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v0.xml)

      Then copy the file time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v0.xml to /etc/daq/delays/ and link it as in 1-d)

*********************************************************************************************************************************** 

     Suppose you want to move the
     timing of the first half of x1 and of the second one of x2 to make them 
     closer to 137.5 (x1 and x2 in ns).
     (the starting xml file is time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v0.xml )
     In test type: 
     ./ShiftTimeByNew.exe time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v0.xml time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v1 x1 x2

     This will produce the file time_offsets_smXX_after12347_beam_v1.xml, copy and link it as in 1-d)
