\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

The package provides custom components of Geant4 Physics List constructors and 
CMS Physics Lists. Any CMS Physics List includes local components or 
components provided by Geant4.   

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

- CMSEmNoDeltaRay          - obsolete EM physics
- CMSEmStandardPhysics     - standard EM physics equivalent to Option0
- CMSEmStandardPhysics71   - obsolete standard EM physics equivalent to Option1
- CMSEmStandardPhysics92   - standard EM physics equivalent to Option1
- CMSEmStandardPhysics95   - standard EM physics equivalent to Option1 except 
                             muon multiple scattering - G4UrbanMscModel90
                             is used
- CMSEmStandardPhysics95msc92 - CMSUrbanMscModel95 replaced 
                             by CMSUrbanMscModel92 made for tests
- CMSEmStandardPhysics95msc93 - CMSUrbanMscModel95 replaced 
                             by CMSUrbanMscModel93 - keep calorimeter response unchanged
                             for CMSSW_5_X_Y and CMSSW_6_X_Y very similar
- CMSEmStandardPhysicsLPM  - CMSUrbanMscModel95 replaced 
                             by CMSUrbanMscModel93 - keep calorimeter response unchanged
                             for CMSSW_5_X_Y and CMSSW_6_X_Y very similar
                             use ultra-relativistic gamma conversion model above 100 GeV
                             use WentzelVI multiple scattering and CoulombScattring models
                             for muons
- CMSEmStandardPhysicsSync - standard EM physics equivalent to Option1 
                             + Synkrotron radiation active
- CMSGlauberGribovXS       - obsolete alternative x-section for protons, 
                             neutrons, pions at high energy
- CMSHadronElasticPhysicsXS- obsolete alternative hadron elastic constructor
- CMSMonopolePhysics       - extra constructor of magnetic monopole physics
- CMSNeutronXS             - precise inelastic and capture neutron x-sections
- DummyEMPhysics           - constructor where only electron and mu- ionisation
                             are defined
- G4Version                
- HadronPhysicsCMS         - constructor of hadron inelastic physics by name,
                             likely obsolete
- HadronPhysicsQGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT - castom QGSP_FTFP_BERT hadron inelastic 
                             physics created on top of Geant4 9.4,
                             hyperons are simulated with LHEP

\subsection pluginai Plugins
<!-- List the plugins that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
QGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT_EML       - use CMSEmStandardPhysics95msc93 to keep HCAL response
                              unchanged
QGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT_EML95     - alternative  Physics List for 2012 providing better
                              EM shower shape, also kaon and hyperon x-sections
QGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT_EML95msc92- alternative  Physics List for 2012 tests
QGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT_EML95msc93- use CMSEmStandardPhysics95msc93 
QGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT_EML_New   - use use CMSEmStandardPhysicsLPM
