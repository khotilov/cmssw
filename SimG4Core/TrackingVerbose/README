this is an example of turning on selective G4 verbosity
this particular configuration will set G4 tracking verbosity
for every 2nd event (EventStep=2), for events from 0 to 6; 
G4 tracking info printed for each 100th track (TrackStep=100),
for track numbers from 0 to 10000; if you wish, for example,
to print tracking info for every 10th track, set TrackStep=10,
or for each track - TrackStep=1
NOTE: don't forget to turn on VebosityLevel - otherwise only
info on the particle ID and track ID will be printed but nothing
on position, volume, etc.

For example usage, see also
