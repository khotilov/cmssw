	* bin/DumpFile.cpp (hexlify): Finally fix this function to avoid
	sign extension problems in going from signed char to unsigned int
	using a direct cast.

	* src/DQMStore.cc (getMatchingContents): Added the possibility to
	filter MEs based on different flavors of re. The default, for
	backward compatibility, is still based on Wildcards syntax.
