templateForDropbox.txt is a template for the meta data file to be used when exporting payloads into the ORCON/ORCOFF DBs.
Suppose you want to export some payloads, in the tag <tagname> stored in an sqlite file (*.db), into the ORCON DB. So, what you have to do is:
1. rename the sqlite file into <tagname>.db;
2. download the template meta data file;
3. rename it <tagname>.txt;
4. modify it according to this structure:

destDB <connectionstring>
inputtag <inputtagname>
tag <tagname>
since <begin>
till <end>

   where
	<connectionstring> is the connection string,
	<inputtagname> is the name of the tag in the sqlite file you want to export (leave blank if identical to tagname),
	<tagname> is the name of the tag to be exported,
	<begin> is the begin time (first since), optional (leave blank if not needed),
	<end> is the end time (last till), optional (leave blank if not needed). 
5. upload the sqlite file <tagname>.db into the dropbox available for your subdetector;
6. upload the meta data file <tagname>.txt into the same dropbox.

Before putting the files into the dropbox check that both sqlite and meta data files have the same name, identical to the name of the tag you want to export, <tagname>, otherwise the payloads won't be exported and an error will be returned by the shell.
