Welcome to the Physics Analysis Tools Starter Kit


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The software in this directory requires code that is not yet in recent CMSSW
releases. To run this code, you must follow this checkout procedure and use
CMSSW 1_6_8 as your base release:

Thank you for volunteering for the beta testing phase of the Starter Kit!

We'd like to know about your experiences with this toolkit, so I've outlined a questionairre.

These are exclusive categories, so please select the one that most describes you:

1) How familiar are you with C++

[ ] a) I could code a std::map<std::string,std::vector<int> > and have no problem).
[ ] b) I know what public inheritance means but I can't figure out what you're talking about in (a).
[ ] c) I'm still mad we went away from F77.

2) How familiar are you with ROOT?

[ ] a) I've successfully added my own classes to ROOT.
[ ] b) I can book my own histograms and plot them without trouble.
[ ] c) I still use PAW.

3) Have you performed CMSSW analyses before?

[ ] a) Yes, and I probably could actually have written this better than you.
[ ] b) Yes, but not at the expert level.
[ ] c) Are you kidding? You're supposed to be doing this for me!

4) Have you used FWLite?

[ ] a) Yes, I've used it and I love it!
[ ] b) Yes, I've used it but it needs some work.
[ ] c) No.

5) How long did it take you to get from cvs checkout procedure to a plot?

[ ] a) Less than an hour.
[ ] b) Between an hour and a day.
[ ] c) More than a day.

6) What analysis are you planning on doing in CMS?
