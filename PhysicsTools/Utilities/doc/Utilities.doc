\section desc Description
Generic Physics Tools utility classes

\subsection selectors Selectors
- PtMinSelector: <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/UnaryFunction.html">unary function</a> that returns true on objects 
  that have <tt>pt()</tt> greater than a specified cut. The cut can be specified via edm::ParameterSet or via constructor 
  parameter.
- AnySelector: <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/UnaryFunction.html">unary function</a> that returns true on all objects. 
  It is a trivial selector to be used mainly for tests.

- SingleObjectSelector: <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/UnaryFunction.html">unary function</a> that returns true
  or false according to selection criterion specified by the user as a string. Mapping of string variables to
  object methods is done using Reflex dictionary. Should be used in conjunction with the function reco::parser::cutParser
  from the package \ref PhysicsTools_Parser "PhysicsTools/Parser".

\subsection comparators Comparators
- PtComparator: <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/StrictWeakOrdering.html">strict weak ordering</a> that sorts 
  objects by smallest <tt>pt()</tt>.
- PtInverseComparator: <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/StrictWeakOrdering.html">strict weak ordering</a> that sorts 
  objects by largest <tt>pt()</tt>.


\subsection functions Functions
- MasslessInvariantMass: <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/BinaryFunction.html">binary function</a> that computes
  invariant mass of a pair of objects assuming they are massless using the method <tt>momentum()</tt> to retrieve
  their spatial momentum vector.


\section other utilities
- MethodMap: generic map of class methods based on Reflex dictionary. Only selector (i.e.: <tt>const</tt>) 
  methods with no argument with a return type convertible to <tt>double</tt> are contained in the map.
  Method from base classes are also contiained.


\section status Status and planned development
To be reviewed.
