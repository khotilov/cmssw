- General:
Many changes to keep the synchronization with the Full Sim/Reco
Many improvements as well

- Main changes and new features:
New simulation of the HF 
Extended single hadron shower parameterization (up to 1TeV)
Transition to Python
Use HLT/confDB 
Realistic HCAL saturation implementation
Pile-Up at 10 TeV is available
Implementation of the multiple scattering for the muons from hits
The standard collection names are used for the tracks (iterative tracking)
3.8 T magnetic field
