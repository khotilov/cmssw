in the "Supported tags section" )

The main changes and new features for CMSSW_1_7_0 are
Overlapping hits by default in the tracking, fix thresholds for the HCAL hit making, 
adapt to the new crossing frame, adapt to the new SimTrack data format, 
new proton tagger package, use of two tracker geometries at once to avoid two-step 
simulation/reconstruction with a misaligned geometry ; improved but not yet perfect 
HCAL digitization, adapt to the new ECAL preshower and endcap geometry, adapt to 
the new interface of the calibration database, improved but not yet perfect HCAL 
digitization, new pile-up producer, use of TRandom3 random engine instead of 
CLHEP, fixes for the CondDB, implement Ecal saturation
