- General:

- Main changes and new features:
  - DQM migration. 
  - New tracker rechit smearing parameterization. 
  - Use split hits for tracks. 
  - Implement generalTracks (+iterative tracking new
    steps). 
  - Implement new electron seeding (with TID+TEC, dynamic window, etc...).
  - Add material in front of the HF. 
  - Improvement of the simulation of muons from in-flight decays*
- Major bug fixes:
  - The problem with some nuclear interactions giving too much energy in the final
    state has been fixed*
  - A workaround against a problem when reprocessing some full sim samples from
    the genParticleCandidates has been implemented*

- Known issues:
