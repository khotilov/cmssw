\page FrameworkReleaseNotes Framework Release Notes - CMSSW_2_0_x 

- General:
   * Developments needed to achieve the goals of CSA08 and the upcoming global runs.
- Main changes and new features:
  
   * Reading events from 2 tiers which should significantly reduce the requirements for storage of FEVT data. 
   * Support for handling a single run split across multiple files, including proper merging of run products that represent a part of the luminosity for a run when reading those files back.
   * Event filtering tracking will be stored in the provenance system
   * Support for a transient edm::Ref which will facilitate the work of the PAT group.
   * Normalization of the EventMetaTree which will reduce the cost of the per event per object provenance information stored on EDM files.
   * RN  generator service improvements
   * Enhancements to the event selection configuration as requested by the EventFilter group.
