\page FrameworkReleaseNotes Framework Release Notes - CMSSW_1_8_x 

- General:
  - Many of the developments in the area of framework and infrastructure have been internal improvements in implementation, needed for optimization, and are not user visible. 
- Main changes and new features:
  - per file fast cloning is now used in the Pool input/output modules.  This should improve IO performance and memory foot print for application where many branches are copied forward.  For a pure copy application like edmFastMerge, cmsRun now provides identical performance.  Therefor the standalone edmFastMerge will be deprecated.
  - A root Histogram is now an object that can be stored in an event or run tree.  This required a change to the root default ownership policy.  Now users are required to use either the DQM service infrastructure or the TFileService.
  - More raw/reco only objects have been moved to unsplit branches to improve IO performance.
  - firstLumi number of lumi's supported, in an analogous way as firstEvent and number of events
  - malloc tuning feature added to cmsRun - default tune per arch happens at global constructor time, the memory profiler has config parameters that will over-ride the default tune.
- Major bug fixes:

- Known issues:
  - There have been many changes which should in principle reduce the amount of
 memory needed by the IO modules for root.  As of this writing no conclusive measurements of the effectiveness of the changes has been made.
