- General:
	This release (1_7_X) contains many internal FW/Edm changes not visible to users.
There is one important exception to this, listed below.

- Main changes and new features:
	The various get* calls (for example: getByLabel) will now return an 
invalid handle if the requested data does not exist in the event.  The return 
type has also changed to a bool.  It will be set to true if the data exists 
and the handle is valid and will be set to false if the data is not available.
This means that it is no longer necessary to protect these calls with try/catch
block statements and it is strongly recommended that all users move to if/else
constructs instead.
	As an example, this code:

  try {
     evt.getByLabel( EBdigiCollection_, pEBDigis);
     EBdigis = pEBDigis.product(); // get a ptr to the product
     edm::LogInfo("EcalUncalibRecHitInfo") << "total # EBdigis: " << EBdigis->size() ;
   } catch (...) {
     // edm::LogError("EcalUncalibRecHitError") << "Error! can't get the product " << EBdigiCollection_.c_str() ;
   }

	should be changed to

   evt.getByLabel( EBdigiCollection_, pEBDigis);
   if(pEBDigis.isValid()) {
     EBdigis = pEBDigis.product(); // get a ptr to the product
     edm::LogInfo("EcalUncalibRecHitInfo") << "total # EBdigis: " << EBdigis->size() ;
   } else {
     // edm::LogError("EcalUncalibRecHitError") << "Error! can't get the product " << EBdigiCollection_.c_str() ;
   }

	Such try/catch blocks should be replaced with if/else constructs regardless of whether the catch block
uses catch(...), catch(cms::Exception), or catch(std::exception).
   
- Major bug fixes:
	edmFastMerge no longer opens many input files at the same time.  
This fix also went into the later releases of 1_6_X

- Known issues:
	Nothing known at this time.
