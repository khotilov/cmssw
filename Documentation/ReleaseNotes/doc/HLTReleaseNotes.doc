\page HLTReleaseNotes HLT Release Notes - CMSSW_1_8_x


General:

Main changes and new features:

- ShmBuffer:
  - The processId of the consumer (EP) and the time the event is read
(timestamp) are saved for each raw cell. this allows for an event to
be considered timed-out and the respective EP to be killed by the RB.

  - Each reco cell contains now another identifier, outModId, which
indicates the OutputModule from which the even originates. This allows
for the same (raw) event to be written several times, typically to
accomodate for the event to enter different streams with different
formats (e.g. full content into physics stream, reduced information
for calibration stream).

- ResourceBroker (RB):
  - New 'watching' workloop (thread) monitors the time a raw cell is
being processed. If the time-out threshold is reached (current
default: 30s), the EP is killed, and the 'error event' is directly
transfered to the storage manager. A dedicated InputSource will be
needed to read these events, which should be trivial to write though.
  - the accounting of the processIds of client EPs is furthermore
used to keep track of the number of clients, replacing a quite
cumbersome mechanism that was in place before.
  - A new 'customWebPage' (EventFilter/Utilities:WebGUI) displays the
current state of the raw data cell queue.
  - Incorporate above-mentioned new features of EventFilter/ShmBuffer.

- EventProcessor (EP):
  - Added information to HyperDAQ page regarding the timing of
individual modules.


- Storage Manager (SM):
  - Support multiple instances of the same event, as described above
in the ShmBuffer features. Introduce 'outModId' in protocoll with RB.
  - Support SMProxyServer as a special consumer when there are
multiple HLT output modules.


- AutoBU (BU):
  - Provide option to specify CMSSW configuration file, instead of the
autogenerated one.
  - Support creation of several EPs on the same machine, for
performance tests on multi-CPU boxes.
