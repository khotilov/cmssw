\page ReconstructionReleaseNotes Reconstruction Release Notes

- General:
Development cycle open to all sort of backward incompatibilities WRT CSA07 and the 16X/15X releases.

The 17X releases *are not compatible* with any of the previous releases.

You must not process any 15X/16X/13X samples with 17X. If you are lucky the job will
crash. If really unlucky the job will run but will produce nonsense results.

- Main changes and new features:
  - New detector geometry
  - New tracker material budget in reconstruction with addition of almost 100 kg of cables
    WRT to all previous releases. New parameterization and model of material now used
    in tracking
  - major cleanup in PixelMatchedGsfElectron objects
  - further speedup and cleanup in road search tracking algorithm

- Major bug fixes:
  - the material budget used in reconstruction now compatible with that used in simulation
    since 16X. 

- Known issues:
  - Due to ongoing development in this cycle, 170pre5 samples are incompatible with 170pre11 and
    later, including final 170. 

  - You can not run reco in 17X on digis made with 16X and earlier. You must run 
    gen+sim+digi+reco in one go (a la` RelVal) or use digis made in 17X pre11 and later
