- General:

- Major bug fixes:

- Known issues:

<hr>
Main changes and new features by subsystem:

- CSC 
  - Labelling code (for DetId's and cond data) extended to permit (future)
  simulation and reconstruction of extended CSC system (i.e. ME42 station
  which was de-scoped from CMS start-up.)
  - Bug-fixes in RecoLocalMuon/CSCRecHitB for use of conditions data
  (Conditions data access was 'linearized' in 170 release which
  required matching changes in rechit reconstruction.
  These CSCRecHitB fixes were also back-inserted in later 17x releases.)
  - A new algorithm (the 4th) added to RecoLocalMuon/CSCSegment (not default)

- ECAL
 - EcalRawToRecHit implemented (in EventFilter/EcalRawToDigi)

- Electrons
 - Preselection: pt cut replaced by Et cut
 - Full reuse of standard Ctf track buikding code
 - Track collections for Barrel and Endcap unified in one collection. Both for TrackCandidates and Tracks
 - Better separation between cluster-track association and electron object construction
 - Cleanup of configuration files
 - NavigationSchool taken from record (PixelHitMatcher)
 - Rename PixelMatchCgsElectron to GsfElectron

- Photons and Conversions
 - DataFormats:
   - Rename ConvertedPhoton to Conversion.Conversion is no longer a  RecoCandidate. Simple class 
   - Conversion interface cleaned up of all information which is  already contained in Photon
   - Photon now contains a vector of ConversionRef 
 - Only a collection of recoPhotons (module photonsWithConversions) and a  collection of recoConversion are stored in the event
 - Photon Selection: Et cut and H/E cut are applied
 - Bug fix in PhotonProducer and ConvertedPhotonProducer: occasionally  the SuperClusterRef was set to the wrong cluster
 - Looser chi2 cut for conversion track trajectory building

- Tau 
 -Added a HighEfficiency collection to the EventContent

- Particle Flow
 - Data format and Event Content
   - new PFCandidate data format.
     - corrected energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL available
     - charged PFCandidates: reference to the corresponding reco::Track available
   - new PFBlock dataformats: linkData can now hold several types of links: chi2, rechit,tangent
   - modified event content: removed clusters and blocks from the AOD
 - Algorithm
   - link by rechit implemented in ECAL and HCAL, barrel and endcap
   - link by rechit used in HCAL
   - cluster recovery done in HCAL
   - detection of merged photons, using an MVA and the preshower information
     - iterative tracking is used in input
 - Software 
   - the input of the various modules is now defined using InputTags
   - Introduced a lightPFTrackProducer producing PFRecTracks without tracking
     rechits, to be able to run on the AlCaReco stream
