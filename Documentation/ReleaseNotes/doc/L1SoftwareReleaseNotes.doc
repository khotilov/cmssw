    * L1Extra now only produces L1Extra particles
    * HLT seeding now uses HLTLevel1GTSeed module
    * First version of L1CondDB tools available
    * All emulator modules now configured via EventSetup
    * Various Jet Counts now available for use in GT algorithms
    * GCT includes optional 'PiecewiseCubic' jet correction parameterisation + constants tuned on 131 

- Major bug fixes:
   * Missing Et phi asymmetry problems fixed

- Known issues:
   * L1CondDB tools : write-read to SQLite file only succeeds for L1TriggerKey, other objects fail. Under investigation.
