\page CalAliReleaseNotes Calibration and Alignment Release Notes - CMSSW_2_1_x


- General:

- Main changes and new features:
  - Ecal and Hcal            : alignable geometry introduced	
  - Ecal Electron Calibration: added calibration in the Endcap
  - HcalIsoTrack             : regional FED unpacking and new tracking 
  - Hcal dijet uses iterativecone5 instead of cone7
  - DT calibration: added module to check db constants for tTrig
  - Tracker alignment: treatment of components of 'glued' 2D strip modules to misalign wrt to 
    each other 
  - Muon alignment: make the chambers AlignableDets to prepare alignment with RecSegments
  - Conditions:  New CondFormats for pixel and Strip with reduced size.  Use 10TeV beamspot conditions.  Additional conditions (thresholds) for tracker calibration.
  - Global Tag:  Now a tracked parameter
  - AlCaReco: SiStripCalMinBias and SiPixelLorentzAngle can now be run from RECO, since clusters are stored.

- Major bug fixes:
  - In Ecal Phi Simmetry, Hcal dijets
  - In Calibration/Tools  fix ecal xmlwriter
  - fix to adjust handling of monitoring histograms>  No collection anymore

- Known issues:
