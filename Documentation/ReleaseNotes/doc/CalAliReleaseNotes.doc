- General:

- Main changes and new features:
  - Calibration/EcalAlCaRecoProducers : 
    - phi symmetry calibration and Pi0 Calibration do part of the work 
      online (see HLTrigger/special). The AlCaReco step now consists 
      in selecting events produced by the online filter and copying to  
      the appropriate stream. The phi symmetry stream keeps the 
      L1 information to study different MinBias Triggers. 


- Major bug fixes:

- Known issues:
