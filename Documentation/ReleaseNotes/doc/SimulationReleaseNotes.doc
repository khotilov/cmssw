\page SimulationReleaseNotes Simulation Release Notes

- General:

-- Numerous changes in geometry and data formats; 
   release is backward incompatible at the simulation level

-- Simulated hits and digis fully validated, any found differences are
   consistent with changes in geometry

-- Existing interface between generator information and Geant4 is stable


- Main changes and new features:

-- Migration to LCG-HepMC 2.01.08 ensures reproducibility of simulated
   events, as it resolves the issues of generator particles ordering and
   of compatibility with Root I/O

-- Migration to Geant4.8.3.p01, for improvements in physics modeling and
   many bug fixes in geometry overlap cleanup tools

-- Many updates and improvements in CMS geometry application, cleanup 
   of large fraction of volume overlaps (see remarks below);
   Tracker geometry modeled with 9% of the actual weight, no more changes 
   in active material but only in the passive material in the future;
   Ecal EE and ES geometry updated significantly and is close to final 
   configuration;
   Hcal HE - scintillator thinkness adjusted, HF - 1st implementation of
   PMT description, practically clean of volume overlaps;
   Muon CSC, DT and RPC geometry revised and is close to start-up configuration 

-- Castor and ZDC Forward Detectors - simulation and digitization is available
   in the standalone mode; 
   both can be, in principal, included in the CMS mother volumes but need more
   validation and timing tests
   
-- Factorized Crossing Frame implemented, related packages adapted accordingly;
   implementation of play-back option for Mixing has started
   
-- Digitization sequences is fully reproducible for all CMS subsystems

-- Partial migration (at the data formats level) from CLHEP to Root/Math vectors
   

- Major bug fixes:

-- Tracker geometry is clean of volume overlaps

-- Ecal EE and ES geometry is practically clean of overlaps (minor complains 
   remain, probably due to imperfection in the Geant4 tools)

-- Hcal geometry practically clean of overlaps;
   HF shower library fixed; HF digitization bug fixed

-- Muon CSC, DT and RPC geometry significantly cleaned of volume overlaps but 
   some issues remain;
   fix CSC sim-reco geometry interface;
   fixes in RPC: bx assignment for Endcap stations, reading of external file
   to set the expected time window, numbering strips for noise

-- Vertex smearing - fixed old (since OSCAR) bug of improper vertex time record 


- Known issues:

-- CMS simulation is currently not reproducible in the sim hits part, presumably 
   due to recently-found problems in Geant4.8.3-cycle (CHIPS model); 
   it's under investigation and  will be hopefully solved in G4.9.0.p01
