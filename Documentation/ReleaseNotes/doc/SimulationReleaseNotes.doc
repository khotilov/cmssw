\page SimulationReleaseNotes Simulation Release Notes - CMSSW_2_0_x 

- General:
 - Geant4.9.p01 is used starting 2_0_x cycle; physics performance and technical 
   characteristics have been validated
 - redesigned MixingModule is icurrently in validation, concerns about memory consumption 
   have been raised and are been investigated
 - GFlash structure has been finalized; EM shower model tuned to full simulation, HAD
   model tuning in the work, lateral profiles reasonably tuned; infrastructure ready
   to tuning to the data 

- Main changes and new features:
 - Large number of Validation packages adapted to the new structure: Global, ECAL,
   Muon-CSC; HCAL and Tracker are in progress
 - Tracker: 
  - passive material budget increased by ~5% in the eta region of ~2
  - hit assiciator revised and reflects possibility to retrieve a unique SimHit
    from CrossingFrame list
 - ECAL:
  - Birk's law settings definition is in progress
  - nuclear counter effect implementation is in progress
 - HCAL:
  - noise simulation (PMT window events) is in progress and includes 2 aspects:
    HPD noise simulation and particles directly hitting the PMT window and giving 
    abnormaly high signal
 - Muon-CSC: 
  - better description of the ME11 chambers (material, dimensions, position)
  - description of the Muon Yoke updated from negineering drawings
 - Muon-RPC: SimDigiLink finalized


- Major bug fixes:
 - Vertex smearing bug found (single bunch value was used for lumimous region,
   neglected reduction by 1/sqrt(2) in overlap of 2 colliding bunches); bux fixed

- Known issues:
 - Lack of reproducibility remains a concern, in Hadronic showers modeling and 
   is the works by the Geant4 team
