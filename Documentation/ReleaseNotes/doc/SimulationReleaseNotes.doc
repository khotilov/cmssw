\page SimulationReleaseNotes Simulation Release Notes - CMSSW_2_1_x 

- General:
 - Migration to python configurations (common throughout CMSSW)
 - use of Geant4.9.p02 version, which contains a number of important bug fixes; additional fixes 
   (from Geant4 repository, will become official soon) are being tested

- Main changes and new features:
 - Physics processes modeling: new physics list QGSP_BERT_EMV (per tests/conclusions of the  Calo
   Task Force), application of the Birks' law in ECAL crystals (L3 parameterization)
 - Updates in GFlash, ongoing tuning of parametrized Hadronic showers
 - Geometry: Ideal geometry is replaced by Pilot2 geometry ((e.g. no ECAL preshower) for the 2_1_0 
   production
 - Magnetic field: 3.8T field will be used at the LHC startup (instead of 4T), after extesive
   validation
 - MixingModule: better handling of memory by loading only needed branches
 - Data Mixer: validation and debugging of tracker ongoing, calorimteres are combined at digi level, 
   HCAL has started its checks 
 - TrackingParticle: all particles are stored in one container, additional methods provided
   to access separately hits in the Tracker or in the Muon system 
 - Interface to Generators: p-cut is now used instead of p_t cut; eta cut application reviewed 
   to account for the effective position of the particle; decay chain of long-lived particles entering 
   the detector acceptance is now accepted in full (rather than only 1 level up to an immediate parent)

- Major bug fixes:
 - No major bug fixes in the CMS simulation application

- Known issues:
 - Event non-reproducibility at the Geant4 level remains an issue and is under investigation
 - Some ROOT I/O related issues remain in MixingModule
