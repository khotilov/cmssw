- General:

This release target is an on-line event display for GREN. 

- Main changes and new features:

Active configurable parameters for visualization cuts and a GUI editor
to change these parameters interactively.

Fully configurable automatic start up of the event display with a
configurable time delay between requesting events.

Central exception handling by the visualization framework: either GUI pop ups or silent.

Better messaging on the status bar: which displays what is going on.

Simulated track labels added. Enabled by default. Configurable.

Simulated hits not connected by default. Configurable.

Separation between known event display connections and
unknown. Unknown event display collections are grayed out and put in a
separate tree brunch.

Fully configurable iglets: Reco/Tracker, Reco/Ecal, etc.

Updated geometry for RPC and Absorber in end-caps - there is no 4th
wheel.

Basic Clusters display added.

- Major bug fixes:

Crash on picking due to corrupted iv files.

Update of SimTracks on a new event is synchronized.

- Known issues:

Reco/Tracker may not behave normally and some of the twigs may need to
be disabled in cff. The following symptoms have been observed and are
under investigation:

Track display needs TrackExtra and crashes if this is not stored.

TrackTransformer fails to refit the Tracks.

Requesting GeomDet by DetId fails in some cases.
