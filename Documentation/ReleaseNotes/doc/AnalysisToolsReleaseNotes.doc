- General:

  * This is the first release where PAT is available.

- Main changes and new features:

  * First release of PAT code. For details, see:

      https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuidePAT

  * Switch from GenParticleCandidate to GenParticle as AOD and RECO format
    for generator event. For deatils, see:

      https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/WorkBookGenParticleCandidate

  * Common vertex fit supports long lived particles. For details see:

      https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideCandVertexFit

  * Cut and expression parser now suport nested method calls. 
    For more details, see:

      https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuidePhysicsCutParser  

  * All Physics Tools modules support output format as vector<XYZ> instead
    of OwnVector<Candidate>, and View<Candidate> as input format.

- Major bug fixes:

  * In release 2.0.0 PAT is not functional. Will be fixed in later 2.0.x

- Known issues:

  * In the cut and expression parser, incorrect expressions like the 
    following, where the operator == is not used, result in a segev 
    instead of throwing an exception:

      "isMuon | isElectron"

    the correct expressions work as expected:

      "isMuon = 1 | isElectron = 1"
