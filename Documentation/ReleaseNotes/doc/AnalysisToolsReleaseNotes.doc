- General:
  - release 1.8.x is mainly devoted to the new HLT data model, so no major changes have been released for Analysis Tools in that release. 

- Main changes and new features:
 - new format for generator particles:
    - std::vector<reco::GenParticle> replaces reco::CandidateCollection.
    - The old format is still left as default. Will move the default to the new format in release 2.0.x
 - added new containers ValueMap and Association optimized for root I/O performances. More documentation in:
    - https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/NewValueMap
    - https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/NewAssociationMap
 - changed internal representation of four-momentum in
   reco::Particle, the base class of all Candidate hierarchy.
   The representation is now in polar coordinates in order
   to avoid possible negative mass with float storage.
 - added support for edm::View<Candidate> in several 
   common anaysis modules. The support will be extended
   in release 2.0.x

- Major bug fixes:

- Known issues:
