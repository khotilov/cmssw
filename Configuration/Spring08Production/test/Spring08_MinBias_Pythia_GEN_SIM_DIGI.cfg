   # Vertex smearing

   # There're several types of Vertex smearing module (Gauss, Flat, BeamProfile, Betafunc, BetafuncEarlyCollisions);
   # the cff's are available for each one :
   # Configuration/StandardSequences/data/VtxSmearedGauss.cff
   # Configuration/StandardSequences/data/VtxSmearedFlat.cff
   # Configuration/StandardSequences/data/VtxSmearedBeamProfile.cff
   # Configuration/StandardSequences/data/VtxSmearedBetafuncNominalCollision.cff
   # Configuration/StandardSequences/data/VtxSmearedBetafuncEarlyCollision.cff

   # Currently, we suggest using Betafunc vertex smearing in the desired LHC configuration
