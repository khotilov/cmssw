\section desc Configuration/StandardSequences 
This package contains the standard configuration fragments (*.cff) for most common use cases and options.

\section files Standard Configuration Fragments

\subsection gen Generator Sequences
<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/Configuration/StandardSequences/data/Generator.cff"> Generator.cff</a> is 
the default configuration fragment for CMSSW Event Generation.

\subsection sim Simulation Sequences

<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/Configuration/StandardSequences/data/Simulation.cff"> Simulation.cff</a> is 
the default configuration fragment for CMSSW Simulation. Requires setup of random seeds for all components
 in play (see below). Consists of the following:

- <b> psim = { <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideSimulation#SimDefSeq">VtxSmeared</a> & <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideSimulation#SimDefSeq">g4SimHits</a> } </b>
 - Includes modeling of the IR spread (see details below) and full-scale Geant4-based simulation of particles passage 
   through CMS detector, in the presence of the magnetic field. CMS detector description and magnetic field record are 
   included in the configuration together with the simulation module (<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/SimG4Core/Configuration/data/SimG4Core.cff">SimG4Core/Configuration/data/SimG4Core.cff</a>)
- <b> pdigi = { mix, doAllDigi, trackingParticles }</b>
 - Includes modeling of pileup (see details below), detector electronics responce for all detector subsystems, and
   association of generator particles and vertices with Geant4-simulated tracks and vertices.
   Specifically, modeling of detector electronics response is composed of 3 (sub)sequences:
 - <b> doAllDigi = { <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideSimulation#DigiDefSeq">trDigi</a> & <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideSimulation#DigiDefSeq">calDigi</a> & <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideSimulation#DigiDefSeq">muonDigi</a> } </b>
  - Includes digitization of Tracker Pixels and Tracker Strips (<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/SimTracker/Configuration/data/SimTracker.cff">SimTracker/Configuration/data/SimTracker.cff</a>), 
    of the ECAL Barrel and EndCap, HCAL HB, HE, HO (<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/SimCalorimetry/Configuration/data/SimCalorimetry.cff">SimCalorimetry/Configuration/data/SimCalorimetry.cff</a>), and
    of the Muon DT, CSC and RPC (<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/SimMuon/Configuration/data/SimMuon.cff">SimMuon/Configuration/data/SimMuon.cff</a>). All included configuration fragments
    contain required geometry setup for a given detector subsystem.

\subsection seq1 Reconstruction Sequences

<a href="http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/Configuration/StandardSequences/data/Reconstruction.cff"> Reconstruction.cff</a> is
the default configuration fragment for CMSSW Reconstruction. Changes with time and is defined looking at the various needs wrt algorithms, 
space on disk, time available for reconstruction. 
At the moment, the standard \b reconstruction sequence is composed of (please note that at least the distinction between 
global/highlevel reconstruction does not really reflect functional aspects):

- <b> localreco =  {<a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideTrackReco#DefSeq">trackerlocalreco</a>, <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideMuonSystemReco#DefSeq">muonlocalreco</a>, calolocalreco}</b>
 - Local reconstruction simulation-compatible (no frontier, no oracle) for all the subdetectors. 
   It includes Tracker Strip, Tracker Pixels, Muon DT, Muon CSC, Muon RPC, ECAL Barrel and EndCap, HCAL HO, HE, HB.
- <b> globalreco = {<a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideTrackReco#DefSeq">ckftracks</a>,  <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideMuonReco#DefSeq">muonreco</a>, <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideEcalReco#DefSeq">ecalClusters</a>, <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideEcalReco#DefSeq">caloTowersRec</a>, <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideEcalReco#DefSeq">recoJets</a>, <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideEcalReco#DefSeq">recoGenJets</a>, <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideEcalReco#DefSeq">metreco</a>}</b>
 - Global reconstruction is the reconstruction within only one subdetector. The standard sequence include only 
   CKF Global Tracking, Muon Reconstruction (STA Muons and Mu+Tk Muons), ECAL Clusterization (Island+Hybrid), 
   Calorimetric Towers, Reconstructed Jets (MidPoint+KT) and Missing ET.
- <b> highlevelreco = {recopixelvertexing, vertexreco, jetTracksAssociator, btagging, coneIsolationTauJetTags}</b>
 - High Level reconstruction. With the caveat as in the previous paragraph, this sequence considers modules which need 
   information from more than a subdetector. The current sequence includes tracking and vertexing with only pixels, 
   vertexing with full tracking, b tagging with track counting, and tau tagging with cone isolation.

- \b reconstruction_plusRS : the same as the default, with Road Search global tracking activated.

- \b reconstruction_plusGSF : the same as the default, with Gaussian Sum Filter global tracking activated.

- \b reconstruction_plusRS_plus_GSF : the same as the default, with Gaussian Sum Filter and Road Search global trackings activated.
