The macro
JetMETAnalysis/PromptAnalysis/test/rootNtupleMacros/src/analysisClass_JPTJetsInfoByRun.C
makes the usual JPT inclusive and dijet selection 
and fills a tree with, for each run:

* runnumber
* SumJetPt (sum of the pt of selected jets with inclusive jet selection)
* NumOfJets (total number of selected jets with inclusive jet selection)
* SelectedEvts (total number of selected events with inclusive jet selection)
* SumJetPt_dijets (sum of the pt of the two selected jets in dijet events)
* NumOfJets_dijets (sum of the pt of the two selected jets in dijet events)
* SelectedEvts_dijets (sum of the pt of the two selected jets in dijet events)

These variables are a function of nruns, the number of 
runs in the tree. 

The macro can be run using the LSF system and will create 
several output rootfiles. To merge these files correctly, 
you have to use the macro
JetMETAnalysis/PromptAnalysis/test/rootNtupleMacros/plotting/mergeTrees.C

This macro takes as input two text files: 
* runslumis, which has to have two columns, the first with run number and 
the second with corresponding luminosity. 
* listoffiles, with the list of rottfiles to merge
and creates a merged file, MergedOutput.root.

On this merged file you can run the plotting macro
JetMETAnalysis/PromptAnalysis/test/rootNtupleMacros/plotting/plotInfoByRun.C
