###### History DQM Instructions #####

The easiest way to run this code is on lxplus, since then all of the DQM files in /afs/cern.ch/.... can be immediately accessed.  To set up the code, do the following:

scram p -n JetMETCert_380 CMSSW CMSSW_3_8_0  

You only need to do this once.  The actual CMSSW version doesn't matter here -- we're only using it to get access to ROOT, so that we can read the necessary DQM files.


To run the code, do the following


cd JetMETCert_380/src
cmsenv
emacs myruns.txt
(Use whatever text editor you want, and name the file whatever you want.  In this case, we'll assume the file name is 'myruns.txt')   Enter each run number to be checked on its own line.  Any reference run should be immediately preceded by a "-" -- reference runs won't be used in determining the default output directory name.  Example file:

-147196
147212
147218
147390

(Here, -147196 is the reference.)  You can also specify the reference run using the -f <run> option on the command line.

To run the histogram generator, do the following:

python new_jetmet_hdqm_script.py  -R myruns.txt

There are many other options you can specify on the command line.  View them via:

python new_jetmet_hdqm_script.py -H



Once you have a new output directory created (DQMOutput_147212_147390 in our above example), generate index.html files for the directory via:

./newmakeAll.py DQMOutput_147212_147390

This will make the appropriate index.html files and subdirectories, and copy the results to RunCertification_147212_147390.

If you run the code with the option "-c", as in:

./newmakeAll.py DQMOutput_147212_147390 -c ,

then the code will attempt to copy the output to hep06.baylor.edu automatically.  For now, don't use this code until you have already checked the output of  RunCertification_147212_147390 created without the "-c" option first.
