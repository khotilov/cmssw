This package converts a CSV (ASCII file with Comma Separated Values) into a MySQL DB. 
The format of the CSV file can be seen in opt_align_simple2DWithMirror.csv (which as its name says it corresponds to the COCOA description file you can find at Alignment/CocoaApplication/bin/simple2DWithMirror.txt). The first two lines have always to be the same. Then you can add N lines, one per each COCOA object whose parameters you want to set. Each line contains the following words:
- ID: database object ID. The CMS convention is that for alignment they should always start with '6'
- type: type of object as given in the COCOA description file
- name: name of object as given in the COCOA description file. As you can see in the example, it should contain also its ancestors, for a unique identification
- centre_X/Y/Z: the coordinates of the centre
- angles_X/Y/Z: the angles of rotation around the three axis
- Then they come up to 12 extra parameters: 
   - param_name: name of parameter as given in the COCOA description file
   - param_value: value of parameter

The number of words has to be fixed in the DB. Therefore if there are some values you don't want to set (but leave those in the COCOA description file), you should put a ' -9.999E9' if it is a FLOAT or '"None"' if it is a CHAR.

To convert your CSV file into a MySQL DB you just have to edit the file 'convertOptAlign.cfg', change the input file name:

         untracked string inputFile = "opt_align_simple2DWithMirror.csv"

and the output file name:

          string connect = "sqlite_file:OpticalAlignments.db"

and run

cmsRun convertOptAlign.cfg

You can use the configuration file 'readOptAlign.cfg' to check your recently created DB, changing first the input file name:

           string connect = "sqlite_file:OpticalAlignments.db"
